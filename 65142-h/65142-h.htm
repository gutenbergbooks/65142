<h2>Translator&rsquo;s Preface</h2>
<p>From whatever point of view we consider
Frederick I,&mdash;more familiarly known as
&ldquo;Barbarossa,&rdquo; because of his red beard,&mdash;whether
as the greatest of the sovereigns of
the Holy Roman Empire, or as one of the most
gallant of the famous crusade leaders, the story of
his life is one of absorbing interest. This little
volume includes a sketch of the events which led
up to his accession to the throne of Germany, of
his various campaigns in Italy after he had received
the imperial crown, and of the disastrous third Crusade,
in which he took part with Richard the Lion-hearted
of England and Philip Augustus of France.
The young reader will probably feel most interested
in Barbarossa as a Crusader, particularly because in
this connection appear the two young knights,
Raymond and Conrad, who became the <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;s</i> of
Barbarossa after the death of their gallant father,
Conrad of Feuchtwangen, on the battlefield. Their
brave exploits in battle, the adventurous ride of
Raymond when he carried to the Emperor the news
of the danger of his father and his little band in the
valley, the capture of the brothers by the fleeing
Turks at Iconium, and the exciting description of
the test to which the Sultan exposed them, will
appeal to the young from the romantic side, while
their noble qualities as Christian knights and their
high manly character should make an equally forcible
appeal, in these days when knighthood can hardly
be said to be in flower.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_vi">vi</div>
<p>In making this translation I have endeavored to
retain the vigorous descriptions as well as the healthy
sentiment and charming simplicity of the author&rsquo;s
moralizing by keeping as closely to the original as
possible. The only liberty I have taken with the
text is the omission of passages here and there,&mdash;without
marring the context, however,&mdash;so as to
make the volume nearly uniform in size with the
others in the series. I have invariably characterized
Frederick as Emperor, referring to him thus as
Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire rather than
as King of Germany.</p>

<h2>Barbarossa</h2>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="h2line1">Chapter I</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Return of the Crusaders</span></h2>
<p>The second Crusade was ended.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>
Exploits as heroic as those in the first
Crusade, under Godfrey of Bouillon,<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a>
had been performed, but no battles as
glorious as those in the first had been fought. It
was a difficult task to wrest Palestine from the domination
of the Turks. Scarcely the tenth part of
the stout champions who set out from the various
provinces of France and Germany returned, and of
this little remnant many were exhausted by marches,
enfeebled by disease, and doomed to speedy death.
Most of the castles resounded with lamentations over
the death of their masters. Widows and orphans
stood wringing their hands around catafalques
in front of the altars in the castle chapels, as the
chaplains prayed for the souls of the noble ones who
had given their lives for the Christian religion in the
far distant wastes of Asia. Every province mourned
its dead, for in many cases the people had lost their
lord and protector, who had restrained cruelty and
lawlessness. Even in cases where these masters had
ruled with an iron hand and, in violation of their
knightly and Christian duties, had maltreated their
inferiors, there was no rejoicing over their death;
for during the son&rsquo;s minority the guardian came into
absolute control and might rob and plunder at will,
while if there were no heir, the Emperor had the
power to place a stranger over them. &ldquo;It is better
to cling to the old ways&rdquo; was a German saying,
even then.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>Felseck was one of the few joyous castles. A
great banner bearing the colors of its master waived
from the loftiest turret. Armed servitors stood
upon the ramparts and the guardians of his widely
scattered possessions awaited his coming at the gates
and portcullises. From the watchtower the warder
scanned the plain, which stretched a long distance
from the castle heights, watching with experienced
eye every cloud of dust raised by each little passing
troop. Many a time the heart of the warder, who
had grown gray in faithful service to his master, beat
more quickly as his keen glance recognized signs of
an approaching company, and repeatedly he brushed
away a tear when he found himself deceived and saw
the company riding off in another direction, or not
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
displaying the colors of the house.</p>
<p>It was already past midday. Many a face was
clouded with anxiety and suspense, and some even
feared that the report of the safe return of the lord
of the castle might be false, especially as so many
reports had proved untrue. Rather than have their
joy turn to bitter grief, it would have been less sorrowful
tidings had they been told at once that
Conrad of Feuchtwangen was no longer among the
living. It would have been a crushing sorrow, but
they could have submitted to the inevitable with
more courage than if they had had to realize that the
hope of his return, once aroused, must give place to
life-long disappointment.</p>
<p>A cloud of dust appeared again, and the warder
gave the signal. A solitary knight was seen riding
swiftly toward the castle. His colors could not yet
be made out, and the occupants of the castle, as well
as the people round about who were awaiting the
arrival of the lord of the manor, hovered between
fear and hope. All watched the approaching
stranger anxiously; many insisted they could distinguish
the colors of the house, but others were in
doubt. When it was certain that the former were
right, then all were eager to know whether he
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
brought joyous or sad tidings.</p>
<p>A trumpet signal was heard in the distance, to
which the warder at once replied. This interchange
of calls announced the approach of a friend of the
house. Rushing forward to meet him, the people
questioned the rider and begged for information.
They followed after his sweating steed and exultantly
surged forward to the castle gate. The nearer he
came, the bigger and more clamorous grew the
multitude, and long before the gates were opened
to him, the people were confident he was the bearer
of good tidings.</p>
<p>Then the castle halls resounded with joyful acclamations
which could be restrained no longer, and
which grew more exultant as another and louder
flourish of the trumpet was heard from the watchtower;
all rushed out to extend their welcome, for,
rapidly as the little band approached, it was all too slow
for the impatient throng. The broad plain was soon
covered with the enthusiastic multitude. All were
eager to witness the return of their good master to his
ancestral halls after the performance of such glorious
deeds in the face of such adverse circumstances.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Stout hands bore the consort of the returning
knight in a litter at the front; and by her side were
her two lovely, fair-haired boys, images of their
father, who could not restrain their impatience and
were doing their utmost to keep up. At last they
met the returning knights. Conrad of Feuchtwangen
quickly dismounted from his great war-horse,
and in an instant his faithful Gertrude was in
his arms. The joy of seeing her lord once more
overcame her, and she clung helplessly to the strong
man who was again all her own after such long
absence, and spared from the dreadful dangers to
which he had been exposed daily and almost hourly.
She had hardly recovered herself before she was
greeted with passionate embraces and expressions
of joy, which the boys also shared. Frightened at
first by the stern, sun-browned face of their father
and the pallor of their mother, they soon regained
their courage. They clung to him and were loth
to desist from hugging and kissing him and calling
him the tenderest of endearing names. Universal
joy prevailed, and tears of sympathy came to
the eyes of many a bearded warrior at the sight of
such happiness. Good wishes and the heartiest
of welcomes were extended on all sides, and
Knight Conrad cordially thanked all, both high
and low.</p>
<p>When the first joyous outburst was over, they
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
made their way to the castle. Gertrude mounted a
beautiful snow-white palfrey; the boys were placed
on their father&rsquo;s war-horse, and supported by his
strong arms they passed through the joyous multitude,
who followed after them. The knight and
his train entered the beautifully decorated castle
halls, while the armed servitors and the people
could hardly find room in the large courtyard.
Evening came, but its cool air did not dampen the
enthusiasm. The courtyard glowed with the light
of torches illuminating the crowd, which was hilariously
but harmlessly celebrating the occasion with
the contents of the castle cellars. Within, in his
high ancestral hall, Conrad sat with his family and
friends at a richly furnished table, and many a
bumper of choice wine was drank in honor of the
happy home-coming. At intervals the cheerful
strains of lutes were heard, and the Minnesingers,
inspired to do their best, sang many a long-drawn-out
story of the heroic deeds of the old German
heroes, in majestic verse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have had enough, noble sirs,&rdquo; at last said
Conrad. &ldquo;Thanks for your painstaking service.
Now join us in celebrating this happy day. You
must be weary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my lord, how could we ever tire of relating
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
the great deeds of our ancestors? Are they not the
source of all the pleasures and sorrows of the present
and future? Do they not inspire emulation of noble
actions, and the exercise of knightly virtues?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their remembrance is a treasure for all time,&rdquo;
said a knight of about the same age as Conrad,
&ldquo;but we have also witnessed exploits worthy of our
ancestors, even if the outcome was not as fortunate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Gertrude, and many joined in her
request, &ldquo;tell us of your exploits in the Holy Land
among the Turkish hordes, even though it may
temper our joy to hear the true account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you see,&rdquo; replied the knight who was called
Frederick of Swabia, &ldquo;we do not return as numerous
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
or as imposing as when we set out. It was then a
goodly sight to look upon,&mdash;nigh seventy thousand
heavily armored knights, not including foot-soldiers,
riding to the Holy War. Hungary and Greece
were astonished when they saw the array, and exulted
over the certain destruction of the Turkish
army. Oh, the treachery of these villains, who expected
their deliverance at our hands and then
placed almost insurmountable obstacles in our way!
They overcharged us in the sale of supplies. Our
hungry men were often obliged to procure subsistence
by force when they were out of money. This
occasioned many fatal quarrels, and we reached Asia
Minor at last needy and sorely troubled. It was
there our real misfortunes began, for the Greeks
carried their knavery to the extreme. Sometimes
when our army, which unfortunately had chosen the
shorter but more dangerous route, arrived at cities,
we were not allowed to enter. There was no way
of obtaining food except in baskets let down from
the walls, for which extortionate prices were demanded.
It was &lsquo;Money, or your life!&rsquo; Often,
when the money was sent up, the rope was not
lowered again, and the unfortunate one, who perhaps
had parted with his last penny, was only laughed at.
Even when we obtained anything for our money it
was wretched stuff, barely fit to eat, and sometimes
poisoned. In some cases lime was found in the
bread, which caused the death of several of our
half-starved warriors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terrible!&rdquo; cried Gertrude, shuddering at the
thought of such suffering, &ldquo;was that Christian-like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Greeks treated us even worse than the
heathen Turks did, and it will always be remembered
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
to their shame. Their guides purposely led
us astray. More than once they disappeared at
daybreak, when they were most needed. Once, to
our great surprise, we found ourselves well-nigh
delivered by those scoundrels into the hands of the
Saracens. For Turkish gold they led us into an
arid waste, where the Turks suddenly attacked us
and, favored by the almost limitless stretch of level
country, surrounded us and used their fatal skill at
fence so dexterously that in a few days the greater
part of the German army was sacrificed. Hardly
the tenth part of it returned to Byzantium. We
were among the fortunate ones, but our friendly
reception at the hands of the Greek Emperor was
poor compensation for our misfortunes. Shame
upon the people of a country who would rather
see their champions perish than aid them against a
dangerous foe!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little grateful for this hospitality, we continued
our retreat as soon as possible. At Nicea we met
the French, who at the outset had as large a force
as our own, and who had met with similar misfortunes.
The most of them had been slaughtered by
the Turks. An agreement was made to take the
remainder to Antioch, whither the King of France
had gone by vessel. Instead of keeping their word,
however, the Greeks detained them in dark hovels,
and left them a prey to hunger and disease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horrible!&rdquo; exclaimed all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But true,&rdquo; said Frederick. &ldquo;Will you believe
me when I tell you that thousands voluntarily surrendered
to the Turks, for they expected and received
better treatment from them than from those
of their own faith?&rdquo;</p>
<p>These dreadful revelations brought tears of sorrow
to the eyes of Gertrude and many of the listeners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last,&rdquo; continued Frederick, &ldquo;we reached
Jerusalem, where also both sovereigns came.
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
Reduced in numbers and half-starved as we were, we
nevertheless ventured to besiege Damascus, but were
baffled again by these Eastern Christians, who, in
consideration of Turkish gold, helped the enemy
and obstructed us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see,&rdquo; interrupted Conrad, &ldquo;we came
back rich in exploits, but not crowned with victory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not our fault,&rdquo; replied Frederick, &ldquo;and
yet it is not just to lay the blame upon Providence.
It is just as unreasonable also to reproach the Abb&eacute;
Bernard of Clairvaux,<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a>
who advocated the Crusade,
as to charge us with responsibility for the failure of
the movement which he was certain would be successful.
The highest human skill cannot avail
against treachery. The grand work of rescuing
the Holy Sepulchre will not succeed until all engaged
in it are animated by Christian love and
harmony, and work together for the common purpose,
allowing nothing to divert them from its
attainment.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">Chapter II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Frederick Ascends the Throne</span></h2>
<p>The German Empire suffered many grave
calamities the following year.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a>
Henry, who already had been designated successor
of Conrad III, suddenly died, and all
hope of filling the vacancy on the throne without
exciting dangerous quarrels among the princes and
their adherents seemingly was gone. The seriousness
of the situation was soon apparent. Two years
passed, and no successor was found. Then the
sudden death of Conrad occurred, causing great sorrow
and even dismay in the German provinces; for
he had been a good ruler, even though he had not
always been successful in securing peace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>The situation was alarming. In Lombardy, on
the other side of the Alps, the great and rich cities
were struggling for absolute independence. Each
of them demanded exclusive privileges and individual
freedom. They refused to pay taxes or take
commands from any one. Each sought to dominate
the others and make them tributary. At one time
they formed alliances to subjugate others, and when
this was accomplished they turned against each
other. One day in alliance with the Pope, the next
with the Emperor, as soon as they were on good
terms with each other,&mdash;which was not often the
case,&mdash;they would join hands against both. Every
device was employed to prevent a lasting agreement
between Church and State, and nothing gave them
greater delight than the desperate conflict between
the Emperor and the representative of Christ, when
excommunications and edicts of outlawry were
hurled from the respective thrones. They favored
the one who would concede the most to them,
though perhaps a few days before they had bitterly
detested and harassed him. They pretended to
submit to the victor, with the secret determination
to throw off his yoke at the first opportunity. Indeed,
in the very act of making an agreement, they
were often planning to break it. Many a ruler had
vainly exerted his utmost power to end this wretched
business. After the death of Conrad, Italian affairs
were in almost inextricable confusion, and the German
fatherland was in almost as desperate a condition,
growing out of lust for power, and oppressive
restrictions. The grand dukes repeatedly defied
the imperial power, and forcibly extorted from weak
rulers privileges and immunities which they used
for their own profit in dealing with their inferiors.
Their vassals, the knights, were humiliated, deprived
of all authority, robbed of their possessions,
and even church and convent property did not
escape spoliation. Many resorted to arms to defend
their rights against the feudal lords, or indemnified
themselves at the expense of the common
people. The freedom of the latter grew continually
less, and their humiliation greater. The regular
taxes were increased and new ones were levied,
until at last the peasant had little left but life. The
industrious workers of the cities hardly ventured to
carry their products to the nearest market without
first purchasing protection from the nobles. Even
then, they were often plundered by having to pay
ransom to save themselves from being dragged to
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
some dungeon.</p>
<p>This is but a feeble description of the wretched
plight of the mightiest Empire in Christendom. To
redress these evils and restore order required almost
superhuman ability, and the princes looked around
in vain for a deliverer. The haughty Henry the
Lion,<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a>
an aggressive, ambitious prince, had no one&rsquo;s
confidence. Some were only solicitous to increase
their personal power, while others lacked the ability
to protect themselves successfully against any
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
assailant.</p>
<p>The dying Conrad, however, took every precaution.
He had experienced the difficulty of ruling
such an Empire, and had decided upon the right man
for the place. His own son Frederick was still a
boy, and Conrad knew the Empire would not be
safe in his hands. He proposed his nephew, Frederick
of Swabia, whom we have already met. In a
full assembly of the princes at Frankfort-on-the-Main,
one praised the heroic courage he had displayed
in the Crusade, another his judgment and
wisdom, a third his knightly virtues, and a fourth
was confident he would shortly put an end to the
long and bloody conflicts of the Guelphs and Ghibellines.<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a>
He was unanimously elected, March 4,
1152. All the German provinces voluntarily and
enthusiastically endorsed the choice of the princes,
and a vast multitude of all classes and conditions
exultantly greeted him when the coronation ceremony
took place at Aix-la-Chapelle, on the tenth of
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
the same month.</p>
<p>No complaint was made this time of irregularity
in the election.<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a>
Some slight regret was expressed
that it had not been conducted publicly instead
of in the Frankfort town-hall, but this was of
little moment. The choice satisfied every one.
All hoped to see the glorious old period of Charlemagne
restored, and considered it auspicious that
the selection was made in a city which, according
to tradition, owed its origin to that great hero of the
olden time; for, when hard pressed by the Saxon
heathen, it was there he discovered a ford across the
Main, which saved his army, and near that spot he
founded the city of Frankfort.</p>
<p>The coronation ceremonies at last were over, and
the various popular entertainments gradually came
to an end. The tumult of the crowds about the
hall was hushed, and only two knights remained,
who walked up and down the spacious apartment
engaged in earnest conversation. The one, although
only of medium stature, was strong and well made.
His piercing glance, so terrible to an enemy on the
battlefield, rested quietly upon his friend and helper.
It was easy to recognize the new Emperor by his
fair complexion, which the burning sun of Asia had
but little browned, his blond hair, and his red
beard.<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a>
The other was Conrad of Feuchtwangen,
his friend and comrade in arms at a time when deeds
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
almost passing belief were performed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know as well as thou, my dear Conrad, the
magnitude of my task,&rdquo; said the Emperor. &ldquo;Whichever
way I turn I find difficult problems, any one
of which will require almost superhuman ability to
solve. Germany and Italy, so widely separated
from each other, are involved in desperate complications,
but I feel that I have sufficient strength
and courage to face the situation and fill my high
position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The princes were certain of that when they
elected thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With divine help I will prove myself worthy
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
of their confidence. The history of our people
shows that the man who is called to high duties,
and places his reliance upon God, is a safe guide
and protector of the people, and such an one often
accomplishes important results in a short time.
The incomparable Charles the Great united all
classes of his people into a powerful whole, forced
the most rebellious to recognize his authority, eradicated
heathenism in a single generation, reformed
the habits of the people by the glorious teachings of
Christianity, and established a well-ordered Empire.
At a later period, when princes failed to profit by
what he had accomplished, when fraternal strife
swept away the best and devastated the country,
they suffered many years from the disgrace of it
and bowed their necks under the yoke of the barbarous
Magyars, until the matchless Henry<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a> came
with all the old authority and the old virtues, and
made the barbarians tremble at the very name of
Germany.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How faithfully thou hast treasured in thy
memory the actions of the great!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have vowed that these men, but above
all that Charles, the noble-hearted founder of German
power, called &lsquo;the Great&rsquo; by the world and
ennobled by the Church, shall be my constant exemplar.
The German authority shall again prevail,
and the German Empire shall flourish again as in
the days of old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet, how many obstacles stand in the way
of this achievement!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charles also encountered obstacles, and certainly
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
as great ones as these, but he finally overcame them.
He found the most potent remedies for the evils of
his time, and we must do the same for ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the evils now are entirely different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think they are very similar. He was forced
to break the power of the grand dukes and protect
the common people, and that is what we
must do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first task may be impossible, for it is extremely
difficult to decide what the dukes have
rightly inherited and what they have usurped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In such cases we shall have to prevent any further
increase of their power,&mdash;the remedy which
Henry attempted to apply. The great cities with
their industries and commerce, where the arts and
sciences are cultivated more assiduously than in
many knightly castles, must employ their wealth
and power to curb insolence and punish offences
against the laws. This will enable them to help
each other and manage their own affairs. They
certainly should know better what is for their welfare
than those at a distance, who are ignorant of
their circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will exercise an important influence upon
the general welfare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True. The Emperor will find in every city a
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
power already organized with which to punish those
who now violate the law with impunity; because
the law-enforcing power is so distant they can escape
with their plunder behind protecting walls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how about the people in the open country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They, too, must have the protection of the law,
and their actions must not be arbitrarily controlled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, noble sire. The Italian cities manage
their own affairs. The possessions claimed by
the nobles were inherited from their ancestors.
They associate freely with the common people, also,
and yet these cities do not enjoy the blessings of
freedom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true, but they mistake their real position
and welfare. They dream of the glorious fame of
ancient Rome, but they have not the slightest comprehension
of its exalted virtues. Where will you
find a Mucius, a Fabricius, or a Cincinnatus? But
at every step you will find a Catiline, a Nero, or
a Heliogabalus. &lsquo;Freedom for us, but none for
others,&rsquo; is the motto of the Lombardian cities, as it
is of Rome. That is the cause of their decadence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you expect to maintain a powerful
authority there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With God&rsquo;s help, yes. I will curb their audacity,
but will concede to them all their chartered
rights. By demanding only what belongs to the
sovereign, protecting the weak against the strong,
and firmly and judiciously administering the government,
there may be a successful result.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;But have you considered what obstacles the
temporal and spiritual powers may place in your
way? Should the latter oppose you, you will find
that bans and interdicts are dangerous and far-reaching
weapons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All honor to the princes of the Church who
administer its sacred functions, but in all my relations
with them the great Charles shall be my exemplar.
Spiritual affairs shall be respected and
protected, as they were by my great predecessor;
but when unjustifiable encroachments are made
upon imperial rights and privileges, I will resist
them just as firmly as he did. Each must keep in
his own place. I will take care not to interfere in
spiritual matters when I have no right to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The union of spiritual and temporal authority
has never been productive of good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For that very reason it is better for them to be
separated. To the emperor, the sword; to the
bishop, the Scriptures. If God helps me, and
grants me the good fortune to win as sovereign
such friends as I have as Frederick of Swabia, I
shall not be uneasy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Conrad knew what the Emperor meant. Honored
by his confidence, he promised him anew his unchanging
love and devotion. He pressed the extended
hand of his royal friend and they separated.</p>
<p>Frederick had an opportunity that very year to
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
demonstrate his authority. Two Danish princes,
who were contending for the crown left by their
father, appeared at the Diet at Merseburg and requested
the Emperor to arbitrate their claims.
Frederick decided Canute should be king and Sven
should be indemnified with territorial possessions.
His decision was particularly approved by the Germans,
because it made Denmark once more a vassal
of Germany.</p>
<p>Two years after this, in 1154, Frederick made
his first journey to Rome, and but for a pestilence
which broke out among his soldiers, would have
permanently settled Italian affairs. Returning to
Germany, he exercised his authority as effectively
as any of his predecessors had done. He summoned
Archbishop Arnold, of Mayence, and the Count
Palatine Hermann before him because of their
bloody conflicts during his absence, through which
several provinces had been devastated. They were
powerful princes, but Frederick did not hesitate to
punish them severely. A dog was fastened to the
Count Palatine and his associates, and they were
compelled to go a mile with it amid the derision
of high and low. The same penalty was pronounced
against the Archbishop, but was remitted
in consideration of his position and age. Soon after
this, the Emperor mustered a strong force and destroyed
the castles of the robber knights along the
Rhine, who had plundered the fertile districts in
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
their vicinity and rendered life insecure.</p>
<p>The German people joyfully listened to the
accounts of these exploits. They were proud of
their Emperor, and hope now rose in many a breast
that all the burdens and misfortunes from which
they had suffered would be speedily removed. The
Emperor hastened from Reichstag to Reichstag,
everywhere suggesting, reproving, and rewarding.
He compelled King Boleslaus IV of Poland to recognize
him as feudal lord and to make compensation
to the children of his brother, Ladislaus; this
resulted in taking Silesia from Poland and making
it a separate duchy.</p>
<p>The power of the Empire steadily increased.
Order and quiet were everywhere restored, the cities
were prosperous and the people were happy and
contented. Feared abroad, loved and honored at
home, the Emperor was at the very summit of his
power. In the Reichstag at W&uuml;rzburg (1157) representatives
from Italy, France, Burgundy, Denmark,
Spain, England, and Greece were present and
paid homage to the German Emperor. The King
of England was also conspicuous in displaying his
good feeling, and sent costly gifts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">Chapter III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Italian Campaigns</span></h2>
<p>There was little sincerity in the protestations
of loyalty which the Italian
cities made to the Emperor; indeed their
disrespect for him was soon openly displayed.
Milan defied his authority with contemptuous
arrogance. Tortoria,<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a> which had been
destroyed by Frederick, was rebuilt under Milan&rsquo;s
protection. The Milanese also demanded homage
from Lodi<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a> and when that city refused to break
faith with the Emperor, they advanced upon it in
force, drove away its citizens, robbed them of their
property, and demolished the city&rsquo;s walls. Complaints
of these acts of violence were made to the
Reichstag at Worms, and after the hearing it was
decided to send an expedition to Italy for the
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
punishment of the audacious rebels.</p>
<p>The expedition was considered all the more
necessary because the Pope had taken sides against
the Emperor, and his legate had declared before the
Reichstag that the Emperor derived his authority
from the Pope. This aroused the indignation of
the German knights, who haughtily declared that the
Emperor occupied a free throne given to him by the
free choice of the German princes; that the Church
was dependent upon the Empire; and that the latter
would not permit any usurpation of its authority.</p>
<p>An armed force more numerous and better
equipped than any previous one crossed the
Alps.<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a>
The Milanese this time appeared to be conciliatory,
for, at the Emperor&rsquo;s summons, a delegation went
to him and sought to justify their conduct. Their
explanations, however, did not satisfy either the
Emperor or the knights, still less the other Italian
cities which had suffered. Milan was declared
under the ban of the Empire, promptly besieged,
and forced to surrender after making a gallant defence.
It was compelled to take the oath of loyalty,
give up its plunder, and promise to let its neighbors
rest in peace. The Milanese were also ordered
to build an imperial castle and send three hundred
hostages to the Emperor&rsquo;s camp. The nobles and
dignitaries, barefooted and with halters about their
necks, begged for clemency. Frederick decided
that it was not enough merely to punish crimes
already committed. Wisdom dictated precaution
against their commission in future. He therefore
summoned four of the most experienced law authorities
and required them to investigate and settle what
rights belonged to the Empire and what to the
cities. He was willing to concede all the rights of the
latter, but he demanded that the cities should take
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
a solemn oath to respect the rights of the Empire.</p>
<p>Everything now appeared settled and most of
the German princes returned home with their
followers; but Frederick was anxious for the future,
and remained in Italy to watch the progress of
events. His fears were justified, for the wildest
confusion soon prevailed. Milan, encouraged by
the Emperor&rsquo;s complications with the Pope, secured
the help of Crema<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a> and other cities, and the struggle
began anew. Crema was besieged by Frederick,
but made a stout defence. The dreadful struggle
lasted seven months before Crema was forced to surrender.
Abandoned by its citizens, it was sacked
and then destroyed.</p>
<p>After obtaining reinforcements from Germany
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
Frederick moved against Milan. The same barbarities
which had marked the siege of Crema
were repeated, and the Emperor could not prevent
his troops from retaliating in kind. He
made a vow not to wear his crown again until
Milan was destroyed. The Milanese well knew
that he would carry out his pledge to the very
letter. As the year drew near to its close they saw
to their dismay that he was not withdrawing his
army as was his usual custom at the approach of
winter, and that the siege was to be continued. It
lasted all winter, but on March 1, 1162, the exhausted
city sent messengers to Frederick, tendering
its submission and pleading for merciful treatment.</p>
<p>Frederick sternly replied, &ldquo;I demand your unconditional
surrender&rdquo;; whereupon the supplicants
abandoned themselves to their fate. Three hundred
knights brought the keys of all the castles and
gates, and thirty-six municipal banners were laid at
his feet. All persons of rank took the oath of
allegiance. The entire population of the city came
barefooted into camp with halters round their necks,
ashes on their heads, and crosses in their hands,
pleading for mercy. As the long procession was
passing the Emperor, the state chariot, bearing the
huge banner of the city adorned with the portrait
of Saint Ambrose, was demolished, and the pride
of Milan was humbled in the dust.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Wailing and wringing their hands, the people
prostrated themselves, begging for mercy in the
name of Christ. Every one wept. Even the
stern faces of the German knights were moistened
by tears; for the severity of the penalty, richly as
it was merited, touched them. The Emperor
alone remained unmoved. Milan&rsquo;s repeated acts of
treachery, and its lust for power, required exemplary
punishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your lives shall be spared,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but the
city, with the exception of the churches, shall be
destroyed. Lodi, Cremona, Pavia, and Como
shall perform the work, and you Milanese must
find homes among these four cities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Remonstrances and prayers alike were of no
avail. The work of destruction began at once and
the sister cities exultantly revenged themselves upon
their haughty oppressor. Soon Milan was no more,
and the other cities leagued with it voluntarily
surrendered. They, too, were destroyed.</p>
<p>The Italian troubles were hardly ended when the
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
presence of the Emperor was urgently demanded at
home. There were quarrels and complications to
be settled everywhere. He travelled all over the
Empire. Now he was at Passau and Vienna, again
at Cologne and Utrecht. From the Reichstags at
Ulm and Laufen he hurried to the eastern frontier
and quelled the Hungarian uprising. Soon after
this he was at the Reichstags of Speier and Nuremberg,
organizing another expedition against Italy.
His representatives there unfortunately had failed
to conciliate his conquered enemies. Their passion
for revenge had smouldered like a spark in the
ashes. Even without their once powerful leader,
Milan, the larger cities had leagued themselves
against the Emperor. Pavia alone remained loyal
to him.</p>
<p>Frederick now devoted his entire attention to
the restoration of order in the refractory cities, but
his customary good fortune deserted him. A virulent
pestilence quickly swept away a large part of
his army, and those who had been weakened by
illness were exposed to the fierce attacks of the
Lombardians, who, emboldened by this disaster
among the Germans, seized all the mountain passes
in hopes of capturing the Emperor. Secret flight
was his only hope of escape. With his true friend
Conrad and a little band<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a> of knights, he fortunately
reached Savoy, and attempted to enter Germany
by way of the mountains; but he was recognized
by his enemies, who planned to murder him in the
night. Their plot was discovered, however. After
considering various ways of escape, a knight, Hermann
of Siebeneich, who closely resembled the
Emperor, offered to lie in his bed while Frederick
made his escape. His enemies were not so inhuman
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
as to punish the knight for his gallant act.</p>
<p>Greatly depressed but not disheartened, Frederick
returned to Germany, where he found plenty to
occupy his attention. Henry the Lion, Duke of
Brunswick and Saxony, the most powerful prince
next to the Emperor, was sorely oppressing his
neighbors. All of them had suffered from his
depredations, the Archbishops of Magdeburg and
Bremen being the special objects of his hatred.
Frederick quickly ended the trouble, however, and
made all concerned promise to keep the peace.</p>
<p>In 1174 Frederick undertook his fifth Italian
expedition. At the outset, fortune seemed more
propitious than before, but this was only an illusion.
He realized that there was no hope of success without
fresh reinforcements from Germany, and Conrad
was sent to fetch them. The latter had often performed
this errand, and knew the roads and all the
dangers attending the task. He did not delay the
faithful performance of his mission. Many of
the bravest knights hastened to the assistance of
the Emperor. Conrad brought both his sons with
him, that they might have their first experience of
war under the greatest princes of their time. That
powerful Prince, Henry the Lion, however, was
angry with the Emperor, although he had been
his benefactor and had increased his possessions.
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
He pretended he was too old for service.</p>
<p>As soon as his reinforcements arrived, Frederick
resolved to risk all in one engagement. The Italians,
who outnumbered his army, made a stand at
Legnano. The fields were decked in their loveliest
attire; the sky arched over the charming spot like
a pure crystal, and was reflected in the dancing ripples
of the Ticino. It did not seem possible that
deeds of slaughter and death could be committed
upon such a beautiful May morning. The hosts
on each side prepared for the fray. Frederick carefully
disposed his troops and gave the signal for attack,
he himself, as was his practice, leading the onset
with desperate bravery. Right and left he drove
the enemy before him. Here he rode with levelled
spear straight against an entire troop, and there he
smote with his mighty war-club, or clove the heads
of the rebels with his two-edged sword, until blood
flowed in streams. Conrad fought by his side with
equal spirit, and with him his sons, who were inspired
by the great examples before them. Notwithstanding
their unflinching courage, however,
they could not force the enemy to give up an inch
of ground, although they hurled themselves again
and again upon the very flower of the Italian army
and fought like desperate giants.</p>
<p>The Germans, with their utmost efforts, made no
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
progress. The Emperor and those about him seemed
rooted to the spot where they stood. Where ten fell,
twenty others immediately filled their places. Frederick&rsquo;s
standard-bearer was felled by a terrible blow.
The standard, emblem of victory, dropped, and the
exultant shouts of the enemy followed its capture.
Frederick grimly gnashed his teeth. He put spurs
to his battle horse, and dashed forward to recover
it. As the noble animal reared, its broad breast
was pierced by a spear; a stream of blood gushed
from the wound, and it fell under its master. The
enemy swept over them like a great wave. Conrad,
mindful of his duty as a vassal and brother-in-arms,
rushed upon them like a lion, but he, too, disappeared
as if into a grave.</p>
<p>When the standard fell, the Germans wavered.
When they no longer saw the gleam of the Emperor&rsquo;s
helmet and heard the exultant shouts of the
enemy, they gave up all for lost. Their noblest
and stoutest fighters either had fallen or were incapacitated
for further resistance. They began to give
way. The enemy charged them on all sides, and
they were soon routed. Thousands were drowned
in the Ticino, and thousands more were killed in
retreat.</p>
<p>The Germans were in a lamentable plight, for they
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
believed they had lost their Emperor. His devoted
spouse, when she heard the news of the disaster,
clad herself in mourning and was inconsolable over
her loss.<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a> The enemy were jubilant, for their most
formidable foe was no more. Then came the news,
which sounded like a romance, that the Emperor
was living, and was safe and well in his faithful
Pavia, to which city he had fought his way with his
friend Conrad. Who can describe the change of
feeling on both sides when this news was confirmed?
To his faithful followers he was still their great
leader and Emperor. To the enemy he was more
an object of fear than a whole army.</p>
<p>As Frederick could not expect any further reinforcements
from Germany, and the Lombardians
feared to take part any longer in outside matters,
an agreement was made for a six years&rsquo; truce, to be
followed by a treaty of peace. Concessions were
granted on both sides. Each retained its own
rights and respected those of the other. This was
as satisfactory to the Emperor as a great victory
would have been, for there was a divine spirit of
compassion as well as of heroic courage in his nature.
He did not love war, but when forced to make war
he was a lion.</p>
<p>A sorrowful duty, which he could not shirk except
at the risk of the disintegration of the Empire,
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
awaited him at home. It will be remembered that
Henry the Lion had refused service to him on the
ground of age, and paid no heed to his earnest pleading
for assistance. His excuse was a lie. He had
shown, during the Emperor&rsquo;s absence, that he was
not too old for war by harrying and attacking his
neighbors. It was the Duke&rsquo;s disobedience and
defiance which forced the Emperor to humble this
insolent vassal. Besides this, the German princes
also demanded the punishment of this disturber of
their peace. Frederick would gladly have effected
his purpose in some mild way, but it was impossible.
Henry failed to appear before the Reichstag
after being thrice summoned. The decision
was then announced that he should be outlawed
as a disobedient vassal and deprived of all his
rights.</p>
<p>Thereupon, the lion-hearted Henry unsheathed
his sword. He feared not the whole German Empire.
He defeated small bodies of the army, but
when the Emperor took the field the end came
speedily. Subdued by the greater hero, he threw
himself at his feet. With tears in his eyes the
Emperor was forced to execute the penalty; for
they had been good friends, and until now there
had been peace between the houses of Hohenstauffen
and Welf. Henry retained only his hereditary
possessions; his feudal tenure and rights were
distributed among more faithful subjects, and he
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
was banished from Germany for three years.</p>
<p>Thus, after years of warfare, the enemies of the
Emperor were either destroyed or they wisely decided
to submit to the stronger power.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Mayence Festival and Tournament</span></h2>
<p>Peace now prevailed both in Italy and
Germany. Frederick regarded the remarkable
prosperity of the Italian cities
without envy, for it contributed greatly
toward the prosperity of the German cities; and
the German people did not withhold their gratitude
to the Emperor for the good fortune they enjoyed.
Frederick indeed was richly rewarded for his great
achievements both in youth and manhood.</p>
<p>In recognition of this great prosperity, the Emperor
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
organized a national festival upon a scale
grander than had ever been known before. At
Whitsuntide of 1184, princes, counts, and knights
from all parts of Germany assembled by his invitation
at Mayence, the seat of the highest spiritual
princes, prelates, abbots, and priests. Strangers
poured into the city in such numbers that they
could hardly find accommodation. Upon the great
plain before the gates a new city of tents quickly
arose, where lodging could be obtained. The
princes entered through the city gates splendidly
mounted and with large retinues. The Archbishop
of Cologne had over four thousand followers. If it
was hardly possible to count the nobles and distinguished
persons, how can the number of people
who streamed in from everywhere be estimated?
It was not so much the brilliant spectacle that drew
these burghers and peasants to the city, as it was
affection for the highest and most revered personage
in the Empire, who had secured peace and prosperity
for them. The joy of the Emperor was the joy of
the people. It exalted the one and glorified the
other. The streets of Mayence swarmed with
people of all conditions. The fields were thronged
by them, and the neighboring mountains loudly
echoed their festive songs.</p>
<p>The Emperor entertained all the princes and
nobles, the strangers and the people of the city for
three days. An incredible amount of food was consumed,
and wine flowed in streams. All were happy
and satisfied, for every one found something that
contributed to his highest pleasure. Some regaled
themselves at the abundant feasts, others admired
the stately knights, the brilliancy of their armor, the
beauty and strength of their steeds, while still others
visited the various sports.</p>
<p>Along the tented city stretched a wide plain, surrounded
by barriers, and in the midst an elevated
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
dais decorated with gaily colored banners, splendid
tapestries, and brilliant draperies. At early daybreak
one morning people stood in crowds by the
barriers, evidently awaiting a spectacle. As the sun
rose, the crowds increased, and distinguished guests
from far and near assembled on the dais. At last
the Emperor appeared, and received an enthusiastic
and long-continued welcome from the people. In
the open space, in sight of the exultant thousands,
he knighted his two sons with his own hands, and
then ordered the tournament to begin. The contestants
in the feats of arms had already been waiting
long. Their powerful battle horses, seeming to
know what was impending, stamped impatiently and
champed at their bits. Their shields, embellished
with their crests and arms, hung upon columns.
The heralds advanced and loudly and distinctly
read the rules and regulations of the tournament,
each one of which must be strictly observed.
After sharply scrutinizing the weapons, helmets,
and shields, and inquiring the name of each knight,
the heralds announced, &ldquo;All are qualified for the
tournament.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The barriers were then opened. The heralds
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
stepped aside, two overseers entered, carrying long
white staves, and behind them followed two knights
splendidly mounted upon fiery, prancing steeds.
They rode around the grounds at a quick gallop,
and as they passed the dais their steeds stepped
more proudly, the knights saluted the Emperor
by lowering their lances, and then took positions
at opposite sides of the barriers. After remaining
there a short time, they couched their
lances with the right hand, and holding high their
shields with the left, put spurs to their horses and
rushed at each other. They came together in the
centre of the arena. Their shields rang from the
impact of the lances, but neither of the knights
was shaken. Changing positions, they rode around
a second time and then prepared for a fresh onset.
It was plain that both were greatly excited. The
spectators, who had been so enthusiastic, were now
quiet, and looked on almost breathlessly as the
overseers advanced near the spot where the knights
would meet. The rush was swift and impetuous.
One of the gallant knights wavered a little, but
resolutely kept his place. Furiously they came
together; a lance was shattered, and its bearer was
hurled from his horse to the ground. The victor
greeted the spectators, received his prize, and withdrew.
The vanquished knight arose, and, to the
delight of all, was found to be unhurt.</p>
<p>Two other contestants were announced with a
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
flourish of trumpets, and their names were loudly
called. There was instant and universal attention,
for it was known that the two cherished an old
grudge, and an open encounter between them had
been prevented only by the Emperor&rsquo;s command.
Would they settle their quarrel now? Easily handling
their high-strung battle horses and testing their
heavy lances with strong, skilful hands, they rode to
their respective positions, while a messenger from
the Emperor was conferring with the heralds and
overseers. Many were apprehensive he might forbid
the contest at the very instant the signal was
given.</p>
<p>The knights were ready at once for the onset.
The ground shook under the hoofs of the mighty
steeds, and there came a fearful crash. Both lances
struck the centres of the shields, but neither knight
moved in his saddle. With a jerk they turned their
horses around and rode back to their positions,
savagely glaring at each other. Their steeds snorted
as if excited by their masters&rsquo; fury and seemed to
know what was expected from them. Like two
mighty billows rushing together the knights met
the second time. The spectators eagerly watched
their every movement. It was a frightful collision:
first, a shock, then a crash like a thunderbolt tearing
its way through dry branches. Both lances were
shivered, the shields clashed together, and the horses
ran against each other.</p>
<p>The next instant the stumps of the lances acre
flung away and the startled heralds and overseers
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
sprang to one side. The broad, two-edged swords
flew from the scabbards, and blow rapidly followed
blow. The horses themselves seemed to know they
were engaged in a life and death struggle, and instantly
obeyed the slightest signal of their riders.
The contest between the evenly matched combatants
lasted several minutes, as neither left himself
exposed at any point or made any mistake in his
sword play. Nor did their thirst for revenge affect
their presence of mind or their caution. Blows fell
with the rapidity of lightning and were as rapidly
warded off. It seemed as if the contest would never
end; but suddenly one of them dealt the other&rsquo;s
horse a mighty blow which clove its head and killed
the brave beast. In a trice its rider was on his feet,
the other knight dismounted, and the fight was renewed
on foot. Their shields had already crashed
together and their swords were clashing with such
force that the sparks flew, when the overseers advanced
at the Emperor&rsquo;s command, shouting, and
interposed their white staves as a signal that the
contest must cease. The knights heard the order
with ill-concealed indignation. They looked at
each other for a moment, breathing hatred and
revenge, but sheathed their swords before they were
stained with blood.</p>
<p>Amid loud applause for their bravery they reluctantly
left the arena and paid their homage to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
Emperor. Their honorable recognition by the first
knight of his time and his mild conciliatory advice
to them exorcised the demon of hatred, and, once
more reconciled, the strong, brave men, who had
just been engaged in a death-struggle, embraced one
another.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">Chapter V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Life in the Castle</span></h2>
<p>After the battle at Legnano, the Emperor&rsquo;s
old friend Conrad, who had almost
miraculously escaped every danger, returned
to Castle Felseck. Those were
sad days for him and his wife, for their two young
heroes had fallen in the first battle for the Emperor.
They did not complain, however, of their sorrowful
bereavement. Their children had been taken from
them in the very flower of their youth, but they
made no public show of grief. The Emperor&rsquo;s
companion-in-arms, formerly so active and impetuous,
spent his time quietly in the desolate halls
of his castle, and consequently had more time to
look after the interests of his dependents than when
every tumult of war called him away from his
home. The fierce passion which used to flame in
his eyes in camp and on the battlefield gave place
to gentleness and compassion. His wife, always a
mother to every one of their dependents, a nurse
for the sick, a consoler for the sorrowing, was now
doubly eager to serve them; for that bitter grief
which only a mother can feel made her all the more
sympathetic. Every day she went down the steep
road from the castle to those lowly abodes where
care and sorrow were usually the only guests. Her
servants went with her, carrying food for the hungry
and delicacies for the sick and infirm. She provided
clothes for the needy, made by her own hands in
her solitary hours. The two found their highest
consolation in dispensing aid and happiness to all
around them, for &ldquo;it is more blessed to give than to
receive.&rdquo; The tears of gratitude and the hearty
&ldquo;God bless you,&rdquo; from those they assisted, richly
repaid them. God, indeed, beheld their acts of
mercy. He, who is all goodness and love, was so
pleased as they untiringly carried out His precepts
and imitated His example, that He filled their hearts
with the highest happiness. A few years after their
bereavement He sent them two little sons, faithful
likenesses of those they had lost. The first-born
brothers lived again in them, and soon the traces of
grief disappeared from Conrad&rsquo;s brow as the lovely
little ones embraced him, pulled his beard in childish
wantonness, or ran their chubby little hands
through his blond hair. Sometimes he would toss
them upon his knees, after they had clambered up
with a boisterousness that seemed like misbehavior,
but was only their clumsy way of showing their
affection. As soon as they were old enough it
was their chief delight to play in the sunshine
the livelong day, to frolic in the castle yard and
the garden, to catch the brilliant butterflies, and
pluck lovely flowers for welcome gifts to their
mother. It was their delight also to visit the stalls
where their father&rsquo;s battle horses were now resting
undisturbed, mount his favorite steed, and imitate
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
his exploits with the help of the groom.</p>
<p>During these years the castle grew more cheerful.
Stranger knights often arrived and met with a hospitable
welcome. Indeed, it had never been refused,
but because of the family&rsquo;s trouble, they had rarely
visited the knight. More and more frequently also
his old friends&mdash;for he had no enemies near him&mdash;came
to see him. Every one felt the highest
esteem for this brave man who had all the knightly
virtues. It was only those barbarous marauders who
could not endure goodness, lofty purpose, and just
conduct, whose strength was never used in defence
of innocence but always for oppression and plunder,
who shunned Felseck. As Conrad once more
assumed the responsibilities of life he did not overlook
the welfare of his dependents. His simple
manner of life enabled him to fill his treasury with
his savings, and he used them to help those who
had been unfortunate and who could not meet their
taxes or other obligations.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>Conrad also looked strictly after the education of
his boys. The mother sowed the seeds of virtue in
their tender hearts, and awoke their reverence for
God in their earliest youth. When they admired
the beauty and diversity of the flowers, and the
lovely hues of the butterflies, and questioned her
with eager words about them, she told them of the
creative power and the wisdom and goodness of
the Almighty; of His care for all His creatures; of
His boundless love for them, and of His delight in
their welfare. She told them that the bright stars,
upon which they gazed so wonderingly, and the
happy life of the animals revealed His glory and
His care, and that the birds always praised Him in
their songs. In this manner she aroused in their souls
the sense of divine power and goodness.</p>
<p>Their father sought to cultivate their minds and
impress them with the importance of the duties of
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
life. He enriched their knowledge of nature. He
explained to them what the relations of one human
being to another should be, and told them that
every one has his duties as well as his rights, and
that while they had duties toward the animals, their
highest and most sacred duties were to their fellow-men.
He did not teach them to treat their inferiors
as if they were hardly human&mdash;much less as barely
deserving a share of the abundant mercies of the
Almighty&mdash;but as divinely created and intended to
rise to higher things. He taught them in the true
Christian sense that all men are brothers&mdash;all children
of God, the one Father, and that if He did not
suffer all to have an equal share in His beneficence,
if it happened that one had more than another,
still each had what was necessary to his real happiness.
He told them that even where one had more,
it was often the cause of bitter sorrow to him, from
which the one having less was spared. Thus there
was compensation for all. He impressed it upon
them also that it was wrong for men to make this
disparity, which God permitted, still greater by
robbery, force, or oppression, and that they should
seek to equalize it so that the suffering caused by
life&rsquo;s various misfortunes should be reduced as much
as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need each other in this world,&rdquo; said he one
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
day to them; &ldquo;and the poor, who have few desires,
often need the rich less than the rich need them.
What might happen to us if a powerful stranger
knight should attack our castle and we were here
alone? He would scale the walls with little exertion;
he would murder, plunder, and burn until
nothing was left. But suppose he should attempt
it now! At one blast of the warder&rsquo;s horn my good
servitors, whom I have protected when they were
in trouble, would rush to our defence, drive off
the assailants and send them home with broken
heads. So it is all over the world. One is servant
to the other, from the lowest menial to the Emperor,
the first and highest person in the Empire. He
cares alike for all, banishes all disturbers of the
peace, decides justly, and makes laws which all must
obey if they wish to be happy. Whoever disturbs
this order or violates the laws richly deserves
punishment, for he is thereby destroying the happiness
of others. Oh, if you had only been with me
in that far-off land where force is the only law,
where one obeys the will of one master to-day and
of another to-morrow, you would have seen how
miserable people can be, and have thanked God
that you live in a land where all obey fixed laws, and
where every one knows what he must do and what
is expected of him. Even the Emperor himself
cannot act entirely alone. He needs the help of
others. He who would be a true knight must be
ever mindful of his calling,&mdash;must protect innocence,
resist enemies, and courageously maintain
justice and support the law. Above all, he must
keep untarnished the shield and escutcheon inherited
from his ancestors, whose portraits upon the
castle walls look down upon him and his deeds and
judge him. By their self-sacrifice and faithful performance
of duty they earned what all enjoy, and it
would be criminally ungrateful were we to forsake
the path of virtue they followed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>Such counsels as these still more deeply impressed
the boys because the living examples of their truth
were ever before them. They saw their father impartially
awarding justice, protecting innocence, and
rescuing the oppressed. When they gladly went
with their mother to the homes of the needy and the
abodes of the sick, and consoled them and distributed
material comfort, the lessons of love and compassion
were indelibly impressed upon their hearts.</p>
<p>With like eagerness and faithfulness they devoted
themselves to exercises for the strengthening of the
body, for their father once said to them: &ldquo;He who
would do good must not merely know how to do it
but also be able. While one should love peace, he
should also be ready for war, for not every one is
peaceful.&rdquo; The boys devoted themselves with the
utmost zeal to the use of arms and practised a certain
number of hours a day under their father&rsquo;s or
some trusted attendant&rsquo;s supervision. They ran,
exercised on the bars, stretched their limbs, and
strengthened themselves by severe tests. They
travelled the woods in light clothing, paying no
heed to storms, or winds, or the heat of the sun.
They cooled themselves in a forest brook, hardened
themselves for the fatiguing exercise of the day,
and returned home refreshed and invigorated. Then
they practised hurling the light javelin at a mark,
until they could use the heavy spear without straining
themselves. They wielded the battle-axe, mace,
club, and broadsword, as if they were giving the
finishing blow to an adversary on the field. How
delighted they were when they were allowed to
mount the war-horse and practise the actual man&oelig;uvres
of battle! They were strong and agile, hardened
against the effects of weather, capable of great
endurance, afraid of no dangers, strong in body and
soul, and qualified for the performance of knightly
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
duty.</p>
<p>During this peaceful period, which lasted several
years, there was little opportunity to practise their
attainments except in the pleasant but sometimes
perilous chase, but soon knight Conrad&rsquo;s weapons
were taken from the armory and the castle resounded
to the tramp of armed men. Fate ordained
that the old knight Barbarossa, who had spent
nearly his whole life on the battlefield, should not
die peacefully at home. From that far-distant Eastern
land where in youth he and Conrad had fought
for the Holy Sepulchre, suddenly came the evil tidings
that Jerusalem, which had been in Christian
possession eighty-eight years, had again been taken
by the Sultan Saladin.<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a>
Of all the conquests, which
had cost so many lives, only Antioch and Tyre remained
to the Christians. The Crescent was victorious
everywhere, and persecutions were renewed, as
in the period before Godfrey of Bouillon had rescued
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
the country.</p>
<p>The complications between the Pope and the
Emperor were settled at once. Frederick&rsquo;s old
heroic spirit was aroused, and he looked forward to
an expedition to the Holy Land as a fitting close
to his life&rsquo;s work. At an assembly of princes held
at Mayence a crusade was decided upon.</p>
<p>How could Conrad help joining it? Was he not
the Emperor&rsquo;s brother-in-arms? Had they not
once, amid disasters of every kind, sworn to fight
together and to help each other to the last
breath? Could he remain behind and rest at ease,
while the Emperor, who was no younger than
he, was in the field? No! To have stayed at
home would have been a stain upon his escutcheon.
He went with a force to Regensburg, the rendezvous
of the Crusaders, and by his side rode his two
stalwart sons, barely twelve and thirteen years of
age, but, notwithstanding their youth, exultant and
eager to face any danger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Third Crusade</span></h2>
<p>It will be remembered that the second Crusade,
under Conrad III, was disastrous to the Christians
in the Holy Land. The discords which
everywhere prevailed and the wranglings and
jealousies of Templars and Knights of Saint John
were not unwelcome to the Turks. There appeared
among the latter about that time the mighty
hero, Saladin, of Kurdish origin.</p>
<p>He was sent with an army by the vizier Noureddin
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
to Egypt, where he achieved such success as a
leader that he made his preparations to dispute the
sovereignty of that country with his master, but the
latter&rsquo;s sudden death rendered his plans unnecessary.
He became Sultan of Egypt and ruler of the whole
country from Cairo to Aleppo, so that his possessions
inclosed the kingdom of Jerusalem in a half circle.
Such an enemy would have been dangerous to a
much stronger city, and was all the more dangerous
to the weak kingdom of Jerusalem because it could
not rely upon concert of action for its defence. Individual
leaders contended with their powerful enemy
and performed deeds of heroism worthy to be compared
with those of the first Crusade, but they were
to no purpose. These warriors were glad when a
truce was made, but they neglected during its continuance
to prepare for the inevitable conflict.
They even went so far as to provoke the enemy.
Rainald of Chatillon, a Christian Knight, committed
an audaciously violent act by robbing the Sultan&rsquo;s
mother of her treasures while she was travelling
through the Christians&rsquo; possessions, and by killing
her attendants; in revenge for which Saladin attacked
him. The Christian army was routed in a
single battle at Tiberias. Guy de Lusignan, King of
Jerusalem<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a> and Grand Master of the Temple, and
most of the knights were made prisoners, and the
whole country fell into the hands of the Sultan.
The crosses were torn from Christian churches;
the emblems and vessels used in Christian service
were carried away, and Moslems assembled for
prayer in the Temple of Solomon.</p>
<p>The appeals of the Christians were heard in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
West, and grew in intensity as the deeds of the
Turks increased in cruelty. And yet it was Saladin&rsquo;s
purpose to avoid carnage. His severest
demand was that each man should pay ten gold
pieces, each woman five, and each child one, for
ransom. Forty days were allowed for payment,
and when the time expired he magnanimously released
two thousand Christians who could not procure
the money, as well as all the prisoners; and
besides this he divided nearly twenty thousand
gold pieces among the enemy&rsquo;s poor and sick.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding such generosity, the old war
spirit was aroused in Europe, as already related.
Crusaders flocked from all sides to the army which
the Emperor was organizing. Every possible precaution
was taken to prevent another disaster. To
rid the army of the rabble which had followed it
before, and which had hindered and annoyed it
and plundered at every opportunity, the Emperor
ordered that no one should accompany it who could
not show at least three silver marks. He also concluded
agreements with Kilidj Arslan, Sultan of
Iconium,<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a>
King Bela of Hungary,<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a> and Isaac Angelus,<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a>
the Emperor of Greece, and received their
assurances of help.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>Frederick&rsquo;s greatest anxiety was that peace and
quiet should prevail in the Empire during his
absence. To secure this he destroyed many more
of the robber barons&rsquo; castles while on the march,
and issued an order that no one should begin hostile
operations without giving three days&rsquo; notice. Henry
the Lion was banished three years longer and submitted
to the penalty.</p>
<p>The expedition set out in imposing array for
Regensburg,<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a>
April 23, 1189, the festival of Saint
George. Whitsuntide was celebrated at Presburg<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a>
and in front of Gran<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a> the army awaited the arrival
of the Hungarian King with his brilliant following.
The Emperor reviewed his army before the city of
Belgrade on the Hungarian frontier, and found he
had about fifty thousand knights and an equal number
of warriors of lower grades. Encouraged anew
by fortune, which thus far had been so favorable, and
relying upon the great strength of his army, Frederick
prepared to lead his pilgrims to the Holy
Land, confident that he would wrest it from the infidels
this time and permanently restore it to the
Christians.</p>
<p>We behold the Emperor Frederick seated in his
tent in camp at Belgrade, with the most famous of
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
his princes and those leaders of his army who were
in his closest confidence. Among them is Conrad
of Feuchtwangen, whose sons Raymond and Conrad
are standing at a respectful distance, awaiting
the Emperor&rsquo;s orders. Owing to the Emperor&rsquo;s
affection for their father they have had the good
fortune to be selected as his pages. After earnestly
discussing the objects of the expedition and the best
means of securing them, they begin to talk of the
assistance they might expect from their allies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us wait,&rdquo; said the Emperor, &ldquo;until our
messengers return, and we learn what Isaac proposes
to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you not fear, your Majesty, that he will
violate his word?&rdquo; asked the Bishop of Mayence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has happened once, or a thousand times,
of course may happen now. But it seems to me
our messengers will know definitely when they
return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall know for certain if they bring no message
of peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case they would hurry back, I think,
for that would clearly be their duty. I suspect the
Greeks will prove faithless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is almost certain,&rdquo; said the Bishop of Passau.
&ldquo;Greeks cannot keep faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not yet absolutely certain,&rdquo; replied the
Emperor, &ldquo;and we must do nothing rashly. Still, I
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
confess I am not over hopeful, for, alas, too often has
the hatred between the members of the two Churches
manifested itself and brought harm to both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let us attack at once,&rdquo; cried the young
Duke of Swabia, Frederick&rsquo;s second son. &ldquo;Let us
fall upon them like a thunderbolt out of the clear
sky, before they can make their preparations to help
the Turks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gently, my dear son,&rdquo; said the Emperor.
&ldquo;You are carried away by excitement. We can do
nothing until we have actual proof of their perfidy.
Your ungovernable zeal would make an enemy of
our ally if he were not one already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is our enemy,&rdquo; replied the Duke of Swabia.
&ldquo;My messenger who is at hand will tell you so.
Tired of the long delay, I despatched an alert and
trusty friend to get some news of your messengers.
His speedy return proves that my assertion is
correct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All present turned their eyes to the door of the
tent and saw a rider in light armor dismounting
from his panting steed. Coming into the tent, he
announced:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isaac is faithless. Our messengers are chained
in dungeons because the Emperor fears you are
coming to take his empire from him. There is a
multitude of his troops in the distance, who have
followed me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;His treachery is beyond all doubt,&rdquo; exclaimed
several of the princes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us act accordingly,&rdquo; said the Emperor, with
great seriousness. &ldquo;As we have not been notified
of the dissolution of the alliance, we will go to Constantinople
and settle matters. So long as the
people do not manifest open hostility to us we will
treat them as friends, but at the same time keep in
readiness to protect ourselves if we be attacked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me lead the vanguard,&rdquo; implored the Duke
of Swabia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are too young and hot-headed,&rdquo; said the
Emperor. &ldquo;There is double need for prudence
and discretion in this emergency. Conrad, my old
and tried friend, you shall lead. It will not be the
first time you have been through the country, and
you know the tricks which those people play at
times, while pretending to be friends. You are
cautious enough not to rush into unnecessary danger,
and yet brave enough to protect yourself
against any assault. Above all, I would fain not see
Christian arrayed against Christian; but if it must be
so, then we will clear the enemies of Christendom
from the way with our good swords.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank your Majesty,&rdquo; replied Conrad, &ldquo;for
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
this unexpected honor, which I hardly ventured to
ask in the presence of so many noble princes, renowned
for their valor and good judgment. I will
ask but one favor. Allow my sons to go with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is granted. And now to our work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The council of war was ended. The vanguard
left at once, and the remainder of the army followed
at intervals.</p>
<p>Conrad&rsquo;s belief in Isaac&rsquo;s treachery was confirmed
at the very outset. He not only did not find the
new bridges which should have been built, but the
old ones had been purposely destroyed. The
mountain passes were obstructed, and hordes of
Bulgarians harassed the gallant little band on all
sides with poisoned arrows. Several stragglers
were killed, and one of the prisoners admitted that
they had been employed and paid by Isaac for this
shameful work.</p>
<p>Conrad at once changed his plans. He began
hostile operations, and informed the Emperor of
the condition of affairs. Philippopolis<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a> was found to
be without a garrison and almost depopulated, but
the Greek troops in its vicinity made no concealment
of their hostility. Frequent encounters took
place, in which the invaders were successful, and at
last Isaac was forced to submit and release the
messengers he had treacherously imprisoned; but
he still remained hostile. The patriarch of Constantinople,
indeed, stated in a sermon that any
one who killed a hundred Germans should have
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
absolution for ten murders.</p>
<p>The Emperor was infuriated by this. He fell
upon the hypocritical knaves and scattered them in
wild flight. Adrianople<a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a> was easily taken, and
Demotika<a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a> surrendered to his son after the first
assault.</p>
<p>Conrad, who was continually at the front, had
the hardest tasks. The Greeks harassed him in
great numbers, but never ventured to meet his little
force, man to man. He and his Germans, who
never seemed to weary, performed prodigies of
valor, and his young sons had plenty of opportunity
to show their knightly prowess. Upon one occasion
they rushed to the defence of their father when he
was hard pressed, and at another they hurled themselves
upon the cowards and displayed the highest
type of knightly gallantry. Victory followed the
Crusaders everywhere. Isaac soon realized that
he was no match for his adversary, and that, while
the Greeks were very courageous when shooting
poisoned arrows at safe distances, they dared not
face German swords. He abandoned his policy
therefore, and a new agreement was made, for
Frederick was anxious not to waste his strength
and lose time. Isaac promised free passage and
the necessary supplies, as well as transportation for
the Crusaders over the Hellespont, and Frederick
agreed to maintain discipline, so that none of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
country people should be harmed.</p>
<p>It is little wonder, however, that after so many
exhibitions of treachery the Crusaders had no confidence
in the renewed alliance, and took unusual
precautions. They rested after the day&rsquo;s hard
exertions, partly mailed and with their weapons
close at hand. They did not think themselves any
too secure, even when surrounded by guards on all
sides. If two or three of the Crusaders discussed
any matter, they made sure that no Greeks were
near, and war councils were always held in the
most secret manner. The Emperor&rsquo;s confidants
alone were acquainted with his plans. No one was
trusted whose faithfulness had not been proved.
This was not because there was any fear of traitors
in the German army, but because a thoughtless
person might let slip a word which would arouse
the malice or excite the cunning of the enemy.</p>
<p>Their stay among these faithless people was
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
a hard trial to the honest, high-minded German
knights. It galled them to have to protect
themselves against an ally as if he were an open
enemy. If he only had been one or the other,
friend or foe, they would have been better pleased.
Hypocrisy was unknown wherever German speech
was heard. They would rather suffer from honesty
than profit from deceit in word or act.</p>
<p>The Greeks, on the contrary, were so thoroughly
degenerate that they were found now on the one
side, now on the other, as one or the other seemed
to offer them the greater profit. Boasting their
Christian orthodoxy, they persecuted with deadly
hatred and sought to exterminate all who differed
with them, so that they were as greatly detested in
western Europe as the Turks themselves. Indeed,
they were so blind as not to see that they were
precipitating their own ruin when they, too weak
by themselves to resist the enemy of Christendom,
were obstructing those who were coming to its
rescue.</p>
<p>It was impossible to convince either these unfortunate
people or their leaders of the fate impending
over them. For a long time already, indeed
for centuries, they had been controlled and held
together only by the absolute and rigorous sway
of their masters. They were not content even
with those mild and wise sovereigns who ruled by
law. Indeed, most of these as well as the tyrants
died violent deaths. Sons, urged on by intriguing
friends, would dethrone their fathers. Incarcerations
and cruel tortures were of common occurrence,
and, as so often happens in this world, the very
agency by which an undutiful son secured his
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
elevation brought about his ruin.</p>
<p>How could any one keep faith in such a country?
Craft and dishonesty were the only protection from
harm. The person in authority was treacherously
flattered so long as it was of advantage; when he
could no longer subserve personal advantage he was
forsaken, and the faithless friend became the most
malignant of enemies. How could such a people,
false to each other, be honest with strangers?</p>
<p>Such were the reasons for the continual distrust
shown by the Germans, and their longing to leave
the country. As soon as all the preparations for
the crossing were completed they started for Asia,
hoping to find more regard for honesty among the
Turks, or at least to meet them as foes in the open
field. The crossing occupied six days, and was
made in Grecian vessels. Even at the last moment
the Greeks did everything to obstruct it, and it was
only the fear of force that restrained them from
violating their agreement and attacking the German
rear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Conrad&rsquo;s Victory in the Valley</span></h2>
<p>At last the Germans reached the sacred land
of Asia Minor. He who beholds it for
the first time cannot fail to admire the
surpassing beauty of the country. Winter,
instead of destroying its luxurious vegetation,
enriches the exceedingly fertile soil with refreshing
rains. The numerous mountain ranges, which traverse
that region in all directions, covered with majestic
forests, present ever-changing spectacles of
beauty. Blooming valleys stretch between them
abundantly watered by clear and sparkling brooks.
Groves of beautiful fruit-trees cover them in some
places, and in others olive-trees delight the eye with
their dark green foliage. Unusually large and brilliant
poppies grow there and the cotton and corn
fields yield abundant harvests. Between its numerous
cities are pretty villages, which add to the natural
beauty of the country. The stranger is impressed
by the thought that life must be very enjoyable
there; but those acquainted with the history of the
people, while admiring all this beauty, only mourn
that men should give way to their evil passions and
change this paradise into a place of wretchedness and
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
suffering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This blessed land,&rdquo; said the Emperor Frederick,
who was well versed in history, &ldquo;has had stranger
and more varied experiences than almost any other
country on earth. Here once stood mighty Troy,
which excelled its neighbor, Greece, in learning and
the arts, until the folly of a prince&rsquo;s son led the
outraged Greeks to destroy it. Centuries later, there
were many peoples here&mdash;among them the Mysians,
Carians, Lycians, Paphlagonians, Bithynians, and
Lydians,&mdash;the last the most powerful of all, and
to whom all the rest were tributary, and whose king
was the richest person on earth.<a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a> But, happy?
No! His wealth tempted Cyrus to invade the
country, and its effeminate people were powerless to
resist him. But Cyrus did not long enjoy his plunder;
nor did Alexander, at a later period. After
the latter&rsquo;s time, the country was split up into petty
kingdoms, which fell into the hands of the Romans,
one after another being subjugated more or less
easily, as the King and people were cowardly or
warlike. The innumerable ruins which everywhere
meet the eye are mute witnesses of the dreadful experiences
of this land. Those wretched hovels cover
the spot where once stood famous Ephesus with its
splendid temple of Diana. The ancient Nicomedia,<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a>
residence of Roman emperors after Diocletian&rsquo;s
time, is to-day an insignificant place. Of many
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
other famous places hardly a trace can now be found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where Christianity in its early stages enjoyed
its greatest prosperity, where the most famous and
the greatest of its communities lived and transformed
the land into a garden, the Turk now rules and
persecutes Christians with fierce hatred and sharp
swords, thanks to the cowardliness and faithlessness
of the Greek Emperor and his people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sad story of desolation which the Emperor
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
briefly outlined to his listeners made a sorrowful
impression upon them, but it also awakened the
sense of duty in their brave souls; and a feeling of
gratitude that they were called upon to rescue and
redeem this land filled the hearts of the brave champions
of the Cross. They even hoped that the Sultan
of Iconium, as the country was then called, would
prove faithless, like Isaac, for then they could act
regardless of him, and victory would be assured.
This singular wish, which was natural enough at
that time, when knights were ever eager to encounter
new dangers, was soon gratified. Kilidj Arslan
proved as faithless as Isaac.</p>
<p>Conrad of Feuchtwangen, leader of the vanguard,
encountered Turkish troops at the very outset. As
soon as he entered the mountain region he was harassed
on all sides by swift, alert horsemen. Every
grove and hill concealed them. As the Germans
approached they dashed out, brandishing their scymitars
or shooting arrows at them. Strong bands
suddenly attacked them in ravines and narrow passes,
and when the Germans attempted to resist in regular
battle order, they disappeared like the wind in
all directions. It was impossible for the heavily
mailed knights to follow them or to force them to
make a stand. Although the attacks were not very
disastrous, as the scymitars made no impression upon
the mail and arrows glanced off from it, yet stragglers
fell easy victims to the Turks. Many were suddenly
killed, and there was no one near to avenge
them. Under such circumstances the stoutest grew
uneasy, even though there were no actual hand-to-hand
encounters. There was no time to rest, for
the enemy was active both day and night. Subsistence
began to fail, and hunger and thirst, the
Turks&rsquo; best allies, threatened to claim the Crusaders
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
for their victims.</p>
<p>Thus matters continued day after day, and each
morning brought more enemies, weakened their own
numbers, and increased the need of subsistence.
The Turks destroyed everything they could not
take with them, and filled up or polluted the wells.
The scanty supplies furnished by the Greeks were
insufficient for the main army, and nothing reached
the vanguard from that source.</p>
<p>It was hard to believe these were the same Crusaders
who presented such a brilliant spectacle in
camp at Belgrade. Wan and worn they sat upon
their emaciated steeds, which dragged themselves
forward like farm horses. The hopelessness of the
situation was depicted upon every face. Their once
glittering arms were stained and rusted from lack of
care, for all their leisure was spent in searching for
roots and herbs to satisfy the cravings of hunger.
Thousands succumbed to their hardships, but the
German knights made no complaint. The influence
of their training was apparent. Accustomed
from boyhood to strenuous exertions they rendered
splendid service on this expedition.</p>
<p>From a lofty mountain ridge Conrad surveyed his
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
little band. Hardships troubled him little; but
when he looked upon his sons, who had been so
full of hope, whose robust health was impaired,
and whose rosy cheeks were now pale, it nearly
broke his heart. When they noticed the tears in
his eyes and inquired the cause, he regained composure
by a strong effort, to show them they must
still keep up courage.</p>
<p>Indeed, there was little time for brooding over
misfortunes, as the Turks were assailing them on
all sides. There lay the beautiful valley flooded
with sunshine, far as the eye could reach. The
fields were luxuriant with verdure, and a plashing
brook sparkled in the sunlight. They beheld an
abundance which they could not enjoy. Suddenly
the Turks rushed up the slope like sand driven
before the wind. Fear seized the knights, but they
summoned up courage and resolved either to conquer
or die. If they could only gain a half-hour in
which to appease the pangs of hunger and quench
their thirst with the cool waters of the brook, they
would die, if they must, or they would fight with
renewed strength, even though the legions of hell
were on the enemy&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>They prepared to meet the attack without command
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
or the need of encouragement from their
leader. They raised their shields with tired hands,
grasped their lances, and stood in orderly array,
awaiting the onset. The Turks delayed, but their
desperate purpose did not escape the experienced
eyes of the knights; their numbers continually
increased and still the attack was delayed. The
knights grew impatient, but at a sudden signal from
Conrad the entire band swept down the slope like
the whirlwind. The front ranks of the enemy were
shattered and gave way. Steeds and their riders
were piled in heaps. Nothing could withstand the
Germans. They dashed into the thickest of the
fight, unmindful of dead or dying, and exchanging
their lances for the terrible battle-axe, they rained
blows upon the Turks, death following every stroke.
It was a terrible harvest of death in that small area.
The Turks were appalled by the sudden attack.
They now recognized their own danger, and advanced
upon the Christians with all the bravery of
their race, and the skill and adroitness of their
methods of fighting. The storm of arrows, which
struck upon the knights&rsquo; mail, unceasingly but uselessly,
was discontinued, for it injured more friends
than enemies. They engaged their foes man to
man, with their sharp scymitars, and tried to perforate
the grooves of the mail; but the Christians
still had the advantage, for they mowed them down
with swords and war-clubs before the Turks could
make use of their shorter weapons. Still the latter
swarmed about the little band like ants.</p>
<p>With the swiftness of the tiger they would leap
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
upon their enemies, cling to them and seek to pierce
the mail where it was weakest; but with equal swiftness
the Christians drew their daggers and used them
with dreadful effectiveness. Hundreds of the enemy
were killed; others, badly wounded, sought safety
in flight, and riderless steeds were rushing about the
mountain side in numbers, and yet there seemed to
be no decrease in the numbers of the enemy.</p>
<p>Resting for a moment, Conrad anxiously scanned
his little band. He was solicitous for the safety of
his sons, who, because of their light armor, were
more exposed than the knights. He saw them in
the very thick of the fight, in turns attacking the
enemy and protecting each other. A number of
fallen Turks showed that the boys were doing their
duty. Conrad noticed that Raymond was mounted
on a magnificent Arab courser and that, while he
was in great danger, he was making a successful
fight. A gleam of satisfaction lit up his face, but
it was only temporary, for almost in an instant it
changed to deadly apprehension.</p>
<p>A Turk, noticing his apparent forgetfulness of
the battle, rushed swiftly at him, seized him in his
powerful arms, and held him as in a vice. Pressing
his heels against the horse&rsquo;s flanks, he sought to
drag Conrad off, in hopes he would be trampled
under the animal&rsquo;s hoofs. But Conrad sat as immovably
as if rider and steed were one, trying to
use his dagger, for his arms were pinioned. His
enemy could easily have killed him with his own
weapons, but he sought to dispose of him in another
way. Slightly unloosing his hold the Turk tried to
drag him aside, so that he might hurl him into an
abyss; but, notwithstanding all his exertions, he
could not accomplish it. Though old and well-nigh
exhausted, Conrad had sufficient presence of mind
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
to improve every advantage and to save his strength.</p>
<p>The Turk now had to consider the danger to
which he himself was exposed in bringing the struggle
to a close. His cries attracted the attention of
the knights. Warding off blows on every hand,
a young Christian champion made his way through
the enemy, dashing over the fallen at the imminent
risk of his life. A skilfully directed blow severed
one of the Turk&rsquo;s arms, and a second stretched
him upon the earth, howling with pain and rage.
It was Conrad&rsquo;s eldest son, whose heroic act had
saved his father&rsquo;s life. They exchanged grateful
looks of satisfaction, and then side by side engaged
the foe.</p>
<p>The Turks soon realized the hopelessness of their
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
efforts. Half of them lay dead or wounded, and
the other half were exhausted with their efforts to
make some impression upon the knights&rsquo; mail,
while the Christians still confronted them with unimpaired
strength. Soon German reinforcements
were seen approaching, which inspired hopes of victory.
The Turks were still making a furious fight,
when a sudden shrill cry from their leader changed
the aspect of the situation. The Turks instantly
disengaged themselves from the enemy, and wheeling
their swift steeds about, rushed down the mountain
side, and quickly disappeared. The Christians
watched them as if dazed. It was like waking from
a dreadful dream. They could hardly trust their
senses or believe their leader when he told them the
battle was over and the enemy had fled; but when he
pointed to the other side of the valley and they saw
the riders vanishing away like ghosts, they were
convinced of their glorious victory.</p>
<p>Their first act was one of thanksgiving to God.
Then they hurried to the valley as rapidly as they
could to seek refreshment. Their tired steeds could
hardly make their way, and many a knight dismounted
and led his horse by the bridle, choosing
rather to suffer himself a little longer than forsake
his battle-companion.</p>
<p>The little band exulted when they reached the
valley. The refreshing water strengthened man
and beast. The fruits of that genial climate satisfied
hunger, and the luxuriant grass was enjoyed by
the exhausted animals. Conrad advised them to
exercise wise moderation, for he knew from experience
that over-indulgence after severe exertion
was injurious and might have dangerous results in
that climate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>The eventful day at last drew to a close, and all
felt invigorated by food and drink. Cooling baths
had revived their strength, and after a few hours of
sleep they hoped to be able to withstand anything
the next day. They now made their arrangements
for rest. A comfortable spot in an olive grove
where they could easily protect themselves was
picked out and sentinels were stationed. Conrad,
however, was very anxious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are safe here for the time,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but the
enemy will again appear with reinforcements to
drive us from this blessed valley, for they well know
that its abundant product is our only salvation.
We are too weak to hold it for ourselves and our
approaching comrades, who are now suffering from
hunger and thirst, while we are relieved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They ought to hurry forward as fast as their
strength will allow,&rdquo; said one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A messenger should be despatched to inform
the Emperor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But whom can we afford to send? Whom
would you deprive of this night&rsquo;s needed rest and
send into danger?&rdquo; said Conrad.</p>
<p>The knight made no reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send me, dear father,&rdquo; implored Raymond.
&ldquo;I am not so weary that I cannot make the
effort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not send the boy! The errand is more
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
dangerous than he imagines. If no one else will
go, I will,&rdquo; said the former speaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no!&rdquo; said Raymond. &ldquo;I am no
longer a boy. I can take care of myself. Spare
your tired bones, for you are no longer the youngest,
and my strength is sufficient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not dispute that. Who could, after seeing
the many deeds you have performed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then assign me to the duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all the more dangerous because of the
strength required. Even if you had a giant&rsquo;s
strength it might be of no avail. You must remember
that the enemy are swarming about us on all
sides. They are hovering between us and the army,
like birds of prey, seeking to swoop down upon
their victims. Foresight and skill, cunning and
shrewdness, alone can avail, and only one whose
steed can equal the speed of their horses may hope
to escape unharmed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I can do better than any of the rest of
you,&rdquo; said Raymond. &ldquo;You are not aware that I
have captured a Turkish horse, one of those incomparable
coursers. Having lighter armor than the
rest of you, I can surely go without danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is fortunate. It almost seems as if the
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
Divine Hand were pointing the way to the accomplishment
of our wishes,&rdquo; said Conrad. &ldquo;I have
no objection, and assign you to this difficult task.
But be wary and alert. Delay not a moment. Let
not weariness overcome you, and be not deceived
by the quiet around you. It is only the noble lion
who openly seeks his prey; the bloodthirsty tiger
lies in wait for the approach of its unsuspecting
victim. So it is with our enemies. When you
reach the camp, hasten to the Emperor&rsquo;s tent, and
if you have to rouse him from sleep, do so, and
urge haste upon him and the army. If that is of no
avail, then tell them of this valley. Tell them they
will find an end to their privations here and they
will long for wings to fly hither. Now depart with
God&rsquo;s blessing, and may He go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A hearty embrace followed these words. The
boy went out, mounted his horse, and flew across
the valley like the wind. The last rays of the setting
sun gilded the mountain tops, and those in the
valley saw the young hero riding as if in a blaze of
golden glory, and waving his hand to them in greeting,
as he disappeared behind the heights. The
little band were soon sleeping, all save the sentinels,
who noiselessly paced their rounds, listening and
watching for any suspicious sound or object.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Raymond&rsquo;s Heroic Ride</span></h2>
<p>Our young hero rode with a stout heart.
His steed showed itself a worthy representative
of the splendid Arab breed.
The waves of a gently flowing stream
could not have borne him more easily. His horse&rsquo;s
hoofs hardly disturbed the soil. It glided with
the swiftness of the wind or the swallow, rather
than ran, and was so perfectly trained that it obeyed
the slightest touch upon its shoulder or pull upon
the bridle. It never needed the spur and yet the
rider, as the noble animal sped along with flying
mane and distended nostrils, making the sparks and
gravel fly, knew that it could make still greater
speed, should that be necessary.</p>
<p>Raymond rode at this speed for nearly an hour.
The night was very dark and so still that only the
echoes of his horse&rsquo;s hoof-beats were heard among the
neighboring hills as he flew at a swift trot through
the ravines and passes. At times he heard the cry
of the hungry jackals in the dense forest, but no
other sounds reached his ears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>Thus in the silent solitude of the forest, far from
friends but perhaps close to lurking enemies, our
hero said good-bye to his youthful days almost before
he had entered upon them, and boldly took up
the work of manhood. He knew nothing of that
silly fear which arises from the imagination. However
or wherever he might encounter an enemy, he
determined to show his knighthood if that enemy
met him manfully. The possibility of defeat never
occurred to him. He felt himself under divine protection.
He believed, as his comrades did, that
this war against the Turks was well-pleasing to God,
and that all engaged in it were under His special
protection, for had not God been with them thus far
in all their troubles? Had He not already guided
Conrad well-nigh to the accomplishment of his purpose?
Since the honor of bringing that purpose
to completion had been assigned to him, surely God
would guide him also and bring him to success.</p>
<p>With such uplifting thoughts his soul was filled
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
as he rode rapidly on, watching carefully all about
him lest he should be surprised by some unseen
danger. His road now lay between two walls of
rock, which loudly echoed the clatter of his horse&rsquo;s
hoofs. The stony ground made the slightest sound
audible. It was one of those spots which the Turks
had defended so obstinately and which the Christians
had taken in their recent gallant attack. While
thinking of the possibility that the enemy might be
lying in wait upon the mountain sides, if not for him
then for the army, and that the outlet of the pass
might be blocked, a slight tremor, but not of fear,
seized him as he heard a sharp whiz through the air
and a sudden blow upon his armor, which he at once
knew was caused by an arrow. Like a flash he
touched his steed&rsquo;s flank. The Arab bounded, gave
a loud snort, and then flew like the storm-wind.
Stooping a little in his saddle, Raymond glanced up
the heights. He thought he saw dark figures gliding
about who had delayed attacking him in their uncertainty
whether he was friend or foe.</p>
<p>There was a great difference between the hoof-beats
of the Arab and those of the Crusaders&rsquo; horses.
Misled by this and by their inability to see distinctly
in the thick darkness, the Turks lost an easy victim.
But Raymond was not yet out of danger. He
heard individual calls, which the echoes repeated
over and over again. It was clear they came from
outposts warning those in the distance of his approach.
He still further increased his speed, for delay now
was dangerous, thinking that by swifter flight he
might reach the end of the pass before the Turks
could oppose him in force. While he was still
some distance from it, the moon rose and shed its
faint lustre upon the mountain sides, making his
enemies look like ghosts. As he urged his horse
to its utmost speed, that he might not be an easy
mark, the ravine was suddenly illuminated with
moonlight, and directly ahead of him a faint streak
of light appeared. It was the outlet of the pass and
beyond it the open country was flooded with the radiance
of the moon. With thankful heart he looked
up to heaven, gently patted his noble horse, which,
seeming to understand the meaning of his caresses,
shook its mane, tossed its head, and bounded along
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
exultantly.</p>
<p>Imagine Raymond&rsquo;s feelings, however, when he
espied two dark figures at the outlet of the pass whom
he instantly recognized as Turkish horsemen. His
good lance was levelled at once, ready for a strong
thrust with his right hand, while his left held his
shield before his breast. He rushed upon them at
a furious gallop with the intention of running down
the one on the right, at the same time protecting
himself against the other with his shield. He had
hardly formed his plan when a skilfully aimed arrow
hit his shield and fell to the earth. His practised
eye saw that it came from the right side. All that
he had now to fear was the other enemy with his
keen scymitar. He must dispose of him before the
archer had time to place another arrow. In an
instant he was upon him, ran his lance into his
breast and threw him from his horse. The animal
struggled and pranced about so furiously that the
archer was confused and his arrow flew wide of its
mark. The prospect of victory encouraged our
young hero. Emboldened by the success of his
first onset, and expecting to be attacked at any
instant by the enemy in his rear, he swiftly turned,
levelled his lance, and rushed upon his enemy.
The Turk was ready for the attack, but as he had
no means of protecting himself against the thrust of
the lance, he dodged aside. The lance struck a tree
near by with such force that it was broken in two.
The Turk&rsquo;s eyes glistened with fiendish delight like
those of a hyena. He swung his scymitar above
Raymond&rsquo;s head with the intention of severing it at
a blow. The Turk&rsquo;s dexterity with this weapon
made the situation extremely dangerous for our
friend. He seized his shattered lance, however, and
hurled it with such force that it averted the scymitar
from its course and knocked his enemy&rsquo;s turban off.
The Turk was furious with rage, but Raymond was
cool. He drew his sword and like a flash smote the
Turk&rsquo;s uncovered head. A dark stream of blood
gushed forth, and a muttered &ldquo;Giaour&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_29" href="#fn_29">[29]</a>
escaped from his lips, as he fell from his steed dead.</p>
<p>Raymond now fully realized the danger of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
position he had been in, and his victory seemed almost
miraculous. Alarmed by his experience and
dreading new dangers, he urged his horse to swifter
flight. Danger was more imminent on those broad
moonlit plains; for his enemies, who had been
swarming round him in the mountains, would certainly
betake themselves to the open country as a
more favorable spot for their operations and more
likely to result in his capture, as their horses were
fresh and well fed. The cowardly thought of avoiding
battle, however and whenever it might come,
never occurred to him; indeed, for an instant, he
was inclined to halt and face his pursuers. His
better judgment, however, told him this would be a
mistake, for in that case he might fail to accomplish
his purpose of reaching the army and delivering his
message. He reflected that the lives of thousands
hung upon his success, and among these thousands
was the noble Emperor and hero, the flower of
chivalry. So he still rushed on, for horse and rider
were unwearied. Two hours later they skirted a
dark forest, shadowed by a mountain range, the last
he would have to cross, for upon its other side were
the army&rsquo;s outposts, and thence the road led straight
to the Emperor&rsquo;s camp. The road here was not
so rough as that where he had made such a fortunate
escape. It wound through gently rolling foothills,
and was seldom stony, the most of it being
covered with a soft, springy turf, upon which his
horse&rsquo;s hoofs made but little noise. While his
progress was easier and swifter, still it was to be
taken into account that horsemen could approach
him on every side and that his pursuers had no
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
obstacles in their way.</p>
<p>The nature of the locality made it more difficult
to find the way in some places than it was in the
mountain region, where the wild torrents which
dashed from the rocks in the rainy season left dry
beds which could be used as pathways. The dense
foliage of the trees also hardly allowed the moonlight
to penetrate it, and more than once Raymond was
in doubt whether he was on the right road. He
tried other directions several times but this invariably
made his horse restless and ungovernable. At
last he decided to let it take its own way, for he
was well aware that the horse is often the surest
guide. The noble animal must have travelled that
way many times while he himself was going over it
for the first time, and besides this he had but little
time to study his way. Stroking his horse, who
had already become very dear to him, as if to compensate
him for the injustice done to his sagacity, he
let him choose his own way. As it no longer
seemed necessary to make such great haste he rode
more quietly and found by the position of the
moon, which at times peeped through openings in
the trees, that he was now riding in the right direction
to reach the end of his journey.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic2">
<img src="images/p02.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="738" />
<p class="caption"><i>Raymond&rsquo;s Ride</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>As Raymond slowly climbed the heights and
grew calmer, he almost forgot all dangers, for he felt
he was near his friends and supposed that his
wearied enemies would not risk a near approach to
their still formidable opponents in the camp by
daylight. He actually imagined that he saw the
white tents of the Christians glistening in the moonlight,
where treeless vistas admitted an open view.
His heart leaped for joy as he reflected that he was
bringing consolation and encouragement to so many
thousands, and a tear stood in his eyes as he
thought of their suffering and fancied the joyful impression
his news would make. He pursued his
way almost carelessly. He was nearing the end of
his journey and gave little heed to his surroundings.
It is not singular, therefore, that he was
alarmed by a sudden noise. Looking back he saw
that he was followed. He thought that three
horsemen, riding furiously, were seeking to overtake
him, hoping to capture him by surprise rather
than by attack.</p>
<p>Raymond slackened his pace an instant to ascertain
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
the real nature of his danger and the best
means of avoiding it. It was impossible for him
to make a successful resistance, for even should he
escape their arrows he must have a hand-to-hand
contest, one against three, and give up as soon as
he was surrounded by them. He was all the more
helpless against numbers as he had lost his lance
and had only his sword for protection. Flight was
his only alternative, and he felt sure that once out
of arrow-shot he would escape.</p>
<p>Throwing his shield across his back he urged his
horse to its greatest speed. It shot away like an
arrow. The hanging boughs of the trees often
brushed his face and he repeatedly crashed through
thickets of dense bushes, which snapped and broke.
It was like the magic wild hunt for the slender,
swift stag of the forest, so quiet were the hoof-beats.
Notwithstanding all the efforts of his noble steed
he gained no advantage over his pursuers. In an
incredibly short time they approached him at the
foot of the range. Raymond could see no trace of
the camp, not even a sentry. Had he been deceived
when he thought he saw the tents? Were
his friends still farther away than he had supposed?
What if his pursuers should be taking different
routes to head him off? Looking around with
hasty glance he noticed that only two were now
following him. He had been carefully instructed
by his father not to act upon guesswork but to
have a fixed course always in view for an emergency.
He decided to give battle only as a last
resort, but he was determined that two of them
should die before he lost his life. Saying to himself
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
&ldquo;With God&rsquo;s help, I will win,&rdquo; he rode on.</p>
<p>He soon realized that the distance between himself
and his pursuers was lessening. One of the
latter must have noticed it also, for he had taken
his bow and was holding an arrow in his right hand.
Raymond felt a terrible apprehension that he might
be killed almost at the goal he was striving to reach.
The road now turned a little to the left and caution
was still more necessary. An arrow grazed his
face. Had his horse made its last step an instant
sooner or an inch farther, he might have fallen and
been trampled upon. He had hardly time to realize this,
however, when a Turk with fiercely gleaming
eyes rode out of the thickets. Swinging his
scymitar he confronted Raymond, who met him
with his sword. The horses came together at such
furious speed that the Turk was thrown, and Raymond&rsquo;s
steed came down upon his knees. He was
down for an instant only, for his rider helped him to
his feet with a stout pull and he at once dashed on,
while the Turk&rsquo;s horse was panting and snorting,
evidently as much enraged as his master, who sent
curses after Raymond as he rode along exultantly.</p>
<p>Suddenly a halberdier confronted him. His
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
horse stopped so quickly that Raymond was nearly
thrown. It was a foot-soldier of the Emperor&rsquo;s
army and at his call several others came up. How
grateful that call in the dear mother tongue sounded!
His only thought was, &ldquo;Saved, saved.&rdquo; He made
himself known, pointed to his enemies, who shot
their arrows and shouted curses at them, and then
took themselves off.</p>
<p>Raymond explained to the outposts the nature
of his mission in a few words. Then he inquired
the shortest way to the Emperor&rsquo;s tent, and as he
hurried on his way to it the warriors&rsquo; eyes beamed
with joy and their lips uttered thanksgivings.
Raymond&rsquo;s message was received with general
exultation. The warriors rushed up to him, caressed
and kissed him, and could hardly find words to express
their joy. Weariness and despondency vanished.
The shout, &ldquo;Forward, forward,&rdquo; resounded
everywhere. After hearing Raymond&rsquo;s report, to
the great delight of all, the Emperor issued the order
to move. Tents were struck at once, and the
advance, led by Raymond, plunged into the darkness
of the forest, while the rest followed as eagerly
as if on the way to some richly appointed banquet.</p>
<p>Though the fresh night air lessened their fatigue
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
somewhat, it was still very great. The tired soldiers,
little refreshed by their short sleep, dragged themselves
along with much effort. It was so dark they
could not distinguish the rough places in the
road. Their weary feet continually slipped and
those on foot repeatedly fell, while horses stumbled
over roots of trees and other obstacles. The farther
they went the more unmistakable were the evidences
that the Turks were aware of their movements and
were on the alert themselves. Those in the advance
had to look out for themselves as best they could,
but even after the utmost precautions many horses
were badly wounded and some of the poorly protected
foot-soldiers were killed.</p>
<p>The real fighting began when the first valley was
reached. The knights fought with all their remaining
strength, and many a Turk, brought to bay, was
slain. They entered the narrow pass, where Raymond
had made his victorious fight, with grave apprehensions.
The Turks in small bands disputed
every inch of the ground with dogged pertinacity,
while others concealed behind rocks and thickets, sent
showers of arrows into their ranks. The knights in
the advance protected themselves with their shields;
but the arrows fell like hail into the dense mass of
those behind them, and it was only here and there
that they escaped injury by holding their halberds
obliquely. Most of the arrows, however, reached the
mark only too surely. They hugged the rocky walls
upon which the enemy were standing, as closely as
possible, and held up broken branches for their
protection. Many of those who neglected such
precautions were wounded.</p>
<p>As morning dawned, their danger increased, for now
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
they were clearly exposed to the assaults of the continually
increasing enemy. Many of the Christians
wrung their hands in despair, bewailed their apparent
fate, and implored God to save them. Just as the
last hope of rescue seemed to vanish, a band of the
enemy suddenly halted in their front and appeared
to be making a hurried inspection of the mountain
sides. Almost immediately they rode at full speed to
the outlet of the pass and disappeared. The Crusaders
were astonished by this movement, and feared
some new trick on the enemy&rsquo;s part; but Raymond
joyfully assured them they were nearing the end, and
that assistance was certainly on the way. His assurances
revived their hopes. They advanced at a
quicker pace, and had hardly gone a hundred yards
before they found the Turks in battle with the
Germans. At a sign from their leader the knights
in front levelled their lances and charged upon the
enemy, who, finding themselves assailed on two
sides, gave way at the first onset. The exhausted
warriors exulted when they saw them in flight, and
a moment later father and son were in each other&rsquo;s
arms; for it was Conrad who had come to the rescue.
After consultation between the leaders it was decided
to keep at a safe distance until they had time to rest,
after which they would consult the Emperor and
decide upon their future operations. When told of
the dangers to which the Crusaders were exposed in
that mountain region, Conrad determined to send a
force, as soon as all were rested, and clear it of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
enemy.</p>
<p>My young readers already know the impression
which that beautiful valley made upon the vanguard.
It was all the greater upon the army, whose
joy was boundless. Troop after troop poured out
of the pass. The wide plain was soon crowded
with the entire German force. The banks of the
stream were densely lined with horses and men, and
it was a long time before the last of the army
emerged. Finally the Emperor appeared, surrounded
by the bravest of his army. He had personally
directed every movement for the protection
of his men, and refused to rest until the last one had
safely reached the valley. Enthusiastic shouts of
welcome greeted them, which the mountains re&euml;choed,
announcing to the Turks that the courage of
the Christian host was still unbroken.</p>
<p>Gnashing their teeth with rage, the Turks disappeared
like ghostly shadows among the mountains
which separated the two armies.</p>

<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Conrad&rsquo;s Death</span></h2>
<p>The intention of Frederick&rsquo;s faithless allies
to destroy his army by hunger rather than
by the sword was frustrated by the indefatigable
exertions of the Germans. Though
greatly reduced in numbers, they had thwarted every
device of cunning and hatred, and though menaced
by continually increasing numbers, had reached the
region they had hoped for&mdash;a region where no German
foot had ever trodden before. They found
everything there which they needed, and even more,
for the enemy had not been able to carry it away or
destroy it.</p>
<p>Frederick, who had accurately divined the plans
of the enemy, only allowed his army to take so
much rest as was absolutely needed, for his foes behind
the mountains were increasing their strength
every day. All the princes approved of the Emperor&rsquo;s
policy to advance at the earliest moment and
overcome the enemy, and not to take a long rest
until it became indispensable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>Conrad again led the advance, and this time the
Emperor&rsquo;s son, Frederick of Swabia, like his noble
father, a true type of German chivalry, accompanied
him. The army followed on foot. The advance
approached the open country on the other side of
the grandly swelling hills unmolested, and there the
knights made their first stand against the Turks,
who confronted them in dense masses. It was then
the German knights showed their prowess. With
levelled lances they charged into the close ranks of
the enemy, dashed them to the earth in heaps, then
with lightning-like swiftness exchanged lance for
sword and battle-axe, with which they fought so
furiously that all who could make their escape fled
shrieking and howling. The onset made room for
those in the rear, and the base of the hills soon
swarmed with Christians, who fiercely attacked the
Turks at a swift gallop and drove them back with
broken heads.</p>
<p>The battle, which lasted nearly all day, showed
that the Turks had been surprised by the Christians
before all their preparations were completed; for as
evening came on, the Christians beheld large dark
masses of troops coming from the distance to
strengthen the enemy. Every one realized that a
great battle was impending on the following day,
and all eagerly awaited it. The Christians gradually
and steadily advanced, in accordance with the
Emperor&rsquo;s orders, while the enemy&rsquo;s force fell back
to support their approaching reinforcements and
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
gain more room for their cavalry.</p>
<p>Frederick and the princes realized that they must
meet a formidable foe. His orders for the disposition
of his forces showed great skill and experience.
The superior numbers of the enemy, which were
continually increasing, and the fact that the ground
was specially favorable to the latter, particularly to
their cavalry, called for the highest skill and most
persistent courage on the part of the Christians. On
the other side, in the rear of the enemy, lay a rich
fertile region, for the protection of which they would
exhaust their resources in order not to crowd upon
their neighbor, the Sultan Saladin, who might be
willing enough to help them, but who would not,
under any circumstances, be disposed to share the
country with them if they were defeated. The only
alternatives for the Christians were victory or death;
for behind them was a malignant, perfidious people,
who had harassed and plundered them when they
were victorious. What, then, might they expect,
if they were defeated, disarmed, and exhausted?
Battle was inevitable, and all were certain it must be
a life-and-death struggle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>On the evening of May thirteen, the Emperor held
another council of war; preparations for the struggle
were thoroughly discussed. Nothing was overlooked,
and every one was asked for his opinion.
As soon as the plans had been settled upon and it
was decided to attack in the morning, all betook
themselves to rest.</p>
<p>Morning dawned after a short, cool May night.
The first faint streaks of light were barely visible
when the outposts noticed a great bustle in the enemy&rsquo;s
camp. As soon as Conrad was informed of it
he ordered Raymond to carry the news to the Emperor&rsquo;s
tent. Raymond found the Emperor already
busily making his preparations. After a hurried
observation of the enemy he ordered that attack
should be made as quickly as possible. The camp
was at once astir. Noiselessly, but with astonishing
rapidity, the eagerly expected commands were executed,
the various divisions led by the princes and
the nobles were massed, and messengers hurried in
all directions conveying the orders of the Emperor,
who meanwhile mounted his battle-horse in full
armor and rode to the front with Raymond. Cheers
greeted the grizzled old hero faring forth to battle
as fresh and vigorous as in the days of his youthful
strength. Victory shone in his eyes and declared
itself in his general bearing. The faintest-hearted
must have been emboldened by his look. The
enemy in the meantime were busily engaged with
their own preparations.</p>
<p>The German army steadily advanced upon the
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
Turks, who at first fell back without striking a blow.
Nevertheless, there were real encounters, for here
and there small groups of the enemy would come
within arrow shot, kill some Christians, and then
swiftly retreat, and avoid pursuit. Many believed
the Turks were repeating their old game, and that
either they did not intend to make a stand or they
were luring them on to some favorable spot where
they could make an attack from every side.</p>
<p>The leaders watched these movements very carefully,
giving especial attention to the enemy&rsquo;s wings
to prevent themselves from being surrounded.
These tactics lasted for some hours, and during that
time the two armies were often so near to each other
that battle seemed inevitable. The Christians were
eager for it, but found no opportunity to attack, for
whenever they made anything resembling an offensive
move, the Turks scattered like chaff. The
Emperor, who kept in the front, repeatedly ordered
an attack, but before a sword could be drawn the
enemy would fly in every direction and render it
useless.</p>
<p>This style of fighting was repugnant to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
Germans and the German nature. They were accustomed
to look an enemy in the eye, meet him
valiantly, and not retreat. This useless expenditure
of strength, this wearisome effort to force the Turks
into an engagement enraged them, and they determined
to make an end of it. As a large body of
Turks came near, the Emperor loudly cried, &ldquo;Why
delay longer to purchase the heavenly kingdom with
our blood? Christ commands! Christ triumphs!&rdquo;
With these words he dashed into the densest of the
enemy&rsquo;s ranks, taking them by surprise. They
waved their scymitars, with loud cries of &ldquo;Allah!&rdquo;
The battle had begun, Frederick fighting like a lion
in the midst of the constantly increasing enemy.
The mailed giants hurled themselves upon the Turks
with all their force, and the fight soon raged all along
the line. Here the Turks swarmed around a troop
of German knights, and there single knights fought
against superior numbers, who strove in vain to
break through their steel mail. Arrows whizzed
through the air; battle-axes and clubs crashed down.
The fight was furious on both sides; where the
German foot-soldiers were engaged, the Turks were
most successful, for being unprotected by armor,
the former were slain by arrows. But when the
full-armed knights, the flower of the army, were
encountered, their assailants fell, never to rise
again.</p>
<p>The noonday sun flamed down so fiercely upon
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
the knights that their armor glowed with heat and
their faces were bathed in perspiration. Some were
hardly able to raise their weapons. They no longer
sought the enemy, being satisfied to repel him when
attacked. The German ranks were already thinned,
but their losses were not so great as the enemy&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The Germans, after almost endless exertions, succeeded
in forcing the enemy back, and looked upon
a field covered with slain. They also heard loud
wailings and lamentations for the dead, which inspired
them with fresh courage. The Turks fiercely
disputed every foot of ground, and every step gained
was dearly paid for. It was apparent that the enemy
either were unwearied or else that they were
frequently reinforced, for each fresh attack was
stoutly resisted. Seemingly it would have been an
endless battle had not night stopped the slaughter.
As the sun went down, its intense heat lessened, but
heated passions did not cool. The whole field resounded
with shouts of &ldquo;Allah!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Christ!&rdquo;
The Germans succeeded in driving the enemy before
them. As the latter fell back they defended themselves
step by step, but as the darkness fell they
suddenly abandoned the struggle and disappeared.</p>
<p>The Emperor wisely and emphatically forbade
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
pursuit. The knights stood by their panting horses
and wiped the sweat from their brows, while the
foot-soldiers gathered about their leaders. They
distrusted the enemy for a long time and held
themselves in readiness to repulse one of those subtle
attacks which were so characteristic of the Turks.
When the spies, however, reported that they could
find no trace of them, Frederick gave orders to
pitch the tents. Every one sought food and drink,
the first requisites after a hard battle. As soon as
all were satisfied, they searched for the wounded,
of whom there were not many thus far; partly
because almost every scymitar blow had been fatal,
and partly because the heat hastened the death of
the severely wounded. Those who could rest by the
side of their own friends and comrades-in-arms were
fortunate. Among these was Conrad of Feuchtwangen,
who held both his sons in his arms, while
they in turn embraced him and murmured prayers
of thankfulness to God for protecting him. Then
the weary ones slumbered, gathering fresh strength
for new victories, of which their souls dreamed while
their bodies rested from their strenuous exertions.</p>
<p>With the first beams of the rising sun, the Turks
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
renewed their operations by approaching the Christians
and daring them to battle. The latter advanced
more quickly than on the previous day so
as not again to waste their strength, and also to
force the enemy back more speedily. The entire
plain was covered with the combatants. It seemed
like some great thoroughfare upon which one crowd
was advancing and the other retiring. Only here
and there did they come together. Except in such
spots, the two movements were continuous and in a
southerly direction. The Christians imagined that
the enemy made this move so as to reach the extreme
frontier of the kingdom of Iconium and meet
the approaching Egyptian troops, and then jointly
attack. The Emperor himself at last came to this
opinion. He regarded it as possible, although he
failed to understand why the enemy on the day before
had made such sacrifices when there was no
prospect of victory. Nevertheless, he completed
his preparations to attack the united forces, and, if
God so willed, to crush them at a blow, and thus
all the more quickly accomplish the object of the
expedition.</p>
<p>The Turks, indeed, made little resistance all that
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
day, and many were so credulous as to believe they
would disappear again as they did on the preceding
day; but toward evening they again rallied in force,
apparently to make a vigorous attack. The Christians
were at once in readiness to meet them. The
princes headed the knights, with levelled lances.
Conrad, with his large retinue, did the same, and
like a terrible thunder storm in a dark night they
hurled themselves upon the enemy. The latter&rsquo;s
dense mass was riven in twain as if by a lightning
stroke, and a fearful hand-to-hand encounter ensued.
Lances were soon exchanged for battle-axes and
war-clubs, and these in turn for swords. The Christians
strove to overcome the superior numbers of the
enemy by separating them so as to attack them in
detached groups, and the plan succeeded. Every
knight was engaged with three or four or more of
the enemy, handjars<a class="fn" id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a> and sabres flashed in the air,
and many a one, who up to this time had escaped
fatal assault, fell lifeless in sight of his comrades,
and his blood mingled with that of his foe. Conrad
and his sons, who as yet were safe, fought like
lions against overpowering numbers, but Raymond
was suddenly wounded in the arm by a blow from
a scymitar. In his anxiety for him, Conrad for a
moment neglected his own safety, and as he turned
to help his son, he received a terrible cut in the
neck. At the same instant Raymond&rsquo;s sword descended
with all the strength of his wounded arm
upon the head of the Turk, who fell dead from his
horse. Raymond&rsquo;s sword, however, dropped from
his hand, and he found himself unable to protect
his father or himself amid a swarm of bloodthirsty
Turks. But help was at hand, for the Emperor
had led his forces to a glorious victory. Those of
the enemy who were not disabled fled before the
lions, who shook their manes in furious rage and
looked about them for more victims.</p>
<p>With tears in their eyes the two youths stood by
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
the side of their dying father. They had laid their
dear one under a great oak tree, which extended its
branches over him like protecting arms, and sought
to stanch his wound. The sight bitterly grieved
the Emperor as he approached. He had found the
steed and shield of his old comrade-in-arms, and
well knew what he had lost; but the spot showed
clearly what his life had cost the enemy, for the
shield was covered with blood and a wall of slain
lay beside it. He at once ordered that his brave
friend should be taken to his own tent and cared
for as such a friend deserved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were it possible to purchase thy life, thou
faithful one, I would give this day&rsquo;s honor,&rdquo; said
the Emperor, with great emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, my noble sovereign, for thy true friendship,
which accompanies me even to the grave,&rdquo;
said Conrad; &ldquo;but I feel I shall not long enjoy it.
Death steadily approaches, and my life swiftly nears
its close. But it would be a great consolation in my
dying hour to know that my sons will be cared for.
I brought them here in the morning of their life
that they might see how brave knights can die for
God and their Emperor. I think I myself have set
them the best example&mdash;I can do no more. Take
them when I am gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will care for them,&rdquo; said the Emperor, &ldquo;as if
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
they were my own sons, and they shall always be
near me. I pledge my life for them as freely and
as courageously as thou hast pledged thine for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dying Conrad cast a look of gratitude upon
the Emperor, then turned to his sons, pressed their
hands to his heart with all his remaining strength,
and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be worthy of your ancestors your whole life
long&mdash;turn not a step from the path&mdash;of virtue&mdash;true
to your Emperor to&mdash;the last breath&mdash;to innocence
a&mdash;protector&mdash;to evil-doers and blasphemers&mdash;an
avenging judge&mdash;and&mdash;I die willingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus Conrad of Feuchtwangen passed away.
All were in tears. Even the Emperor&rsquo;s eyes were
moist. At last he ordered that the body should be
buried with the highest honors, and that Raymond
and Conrad should follow him to his tent and stay
with him in future.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">Chapter X</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Capture of the Brothers</span></h2>
<p>The brothers passed a sorrowful and sleepless
night. Though they felt greatly
honored by the Emperor&rsquo;s protection,
they would rather have grown to manhood
under their father&rsquo;s eyes, learned their highest
duties from his lips, and, inspired by his example,
have reached his lofty standard of honor. They
fervently prayed for strength to face the inevitable,
but no rest came to their tired bodies. Raymond
suffered pain in his wounded arm, and Conrad, who
was greatly overcome by his own exertions and by
the loss of his father, was even more greatly troubled
by the fear that he might lose his brother also and
be left utterly alone.</p>
<p>The morning found them still disturbed by their
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
sad thoughts. There was great activity in the camp.
The Emperor had decided to move at once, attack
the enemy wherever they were found, and destroy
them or force them to make peace, whatever the
cost. The army therefore quickly advanced. The
brothers remained in the camp, the elder because he
was incapacitated for active work, and the younger
to look after his brother, according to what the Emperor
said, but in reality because he did not wish to
expose one so young to the possible dangers ahead
of them. An old henchman, grown gray in the
Emperor&rsquo;s service, was assigned to look after the
brothers and advise with them whenever necessary.
As soon as all these matters were settled, the Emperor
set out in pursuit of the enemy.</p>
<p>On the third day, as on previous days, the Turks
adopted their customary tactics, but the Christians
by this time had gained confidence by the success
of their attacks and knew how to follow them up.
The horses which had been captured were very useful
to the Christian knights, as their own half-starved
animals had a chance to rest. Thus they were in
excellent condition to execute their plan and from
every point of view were ready for battle. Shortly,
they neared the capital of Iconium. They beheld
it in the distance about noon, and felt that their
hardest battle was imminent; and so it proved. The
Turks occupied a better position than on the previous
days, and put forth every exertion to beat
back the Christians. By their peculiar tactics, as
well as by their superiority in numbers, they occasionally
succeeded in forcing back detachments of the
knights, so that they crowded upon the camp.</p>
<p>At last the Turks in overwhelming force directed
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
an attack upon the spot where the Emperor and the
bravest of his knights were fighting, for they knew
the battle must be decided there. Thousands of
scymitars flashed about the heads of the little Christian
band and glanced off from shields and mail.
Hundreds fell victims to German steel, but fresh
fighters took their places as if they sprang from the
earth to avenge the slain. The slaughter was
appalling, for at every blow of the Germans&rsquo; heavy
two-edged swords, death followed. But at last the
stoutest arms began to tire and the bravest hearts to
weaken; for notwithstanding all this sanguinary work
the numbers of the enemy apparently were not reduced.
A brief rest was absolutely necessary and
the Emperor granted it. The knights halted for
rest in vain, however, for the enemy, elated by their
seeming victory, rushed forward and the Christians
were forced back toward their camp. The brothers,
unprepared for battle, were suddenly surrounded in
the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> and were in imminent danger of capture.
Their critical position appealed to the heroic soul of
the old Barbarossa, and he determined to give battle
anew. In thunder tones he shouted to his knights:
&ldquo;Comrades-in-arms, help to defend my <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;s</i>.
Let me not be guilty of breaking faith with the
dying!&rdquo; The next instant he fell upon the enemy,
followed by his faithful knights. Nothing could
withstand them. They charged as the hurricane
sweeps through the forest. Again the enemy
divided up and made isolated attacks, here and
there with success; but the Christians did not waver.
&ldquo;No more retreating!&rdquo; was the cry. &ldquo;Christ commands!&rdquo;
they shouted, and &ldquo;Christ triumphs!&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
was the answering cry.</p>
<p>The Emperor&rsquo;s bold example inspired all. They
not only held their ground, but forced the enemy
to give way. As their courage rose that of the
enemy proportionately weakened. They realized
more and more that all the advantages they might
secure could not compensate them for the loss they
must suffer. The irregular hordes of cavalry, which
had been harassing the Christians from motives of
pure hatred, saw they had been deceived. They expected
to overcome them with ease, but for every
dead Christian there were hosts of dead Turks. The
Sultan himself discovered that his plans had come
to naught, and rather than sacrifice his subjects for
the benefit of an ambitious neighbor, he decided
simply to defend his city until peace was made.
Finding that the Turks were falling back on all
sides, Kilidj Arslan ordered a hasty retreat. His
warriors were so glad that they fled precipitately.
Inspired afresh by this new victory the Christians
rapidly pursued them, and evening found them at
the gates of Iconium and in possession of much rich
booty which the enemy had abandoned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>The Emperor allowed but a few hours of rest,
for he had decided to storm the city while yet the
hearts of the knights beat high with victory and before
the enemy could make the necessary preparations
for defence. Everything was made ready in
the gray of twilight, and at break of day the general
assault began. The enemy, who imagined they
alone excelled in swift movements, found themselves
outdone. Surprised by the unexpected attack, some
of them became panic-stricken, but the most of
them, who were only accustomed to fighting in the
open country, could not stand confinement within
city walls. Troops of cavalry rode helplessly up
and down the streets, seeking some way of escape
and finding none. Desperate over the possibility
of a Christian victory, the foot-soldiers fought upon
the walls. The Germans in the lead, bold as lions,
climbed the scaling ladders in spite of all obstacles.
Descending the walls, they plunged into the very
thick of the enemy, shouting, &ldquo;Christ triumphs!&rdquo;
and piled the streets with Turkish dead. A terrible
panic seized the Moslems, and they fled
helter-skelter, hotly pursued by the Christians. No
resistance was attempted; flight was their only
thought. They dared not surrender to an enemy
whom they had so greatly incensed and for whom
they had shown so little consideration. Indeed,
the Christians would have made them no offer of
peace, so intense was their indignation. From the
Emperor down to the lowest man in the ranks they
fought so continuously and so unweariedly that they
had no time to think of making such an offer, to
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
say nothing of negotiating a treaty.</p>
<p>The Turks at last opened the gates to secure
their liberty and life, and out they poured, with the
Sultan at their head, eager to escape. When they
reached the camp of the Christians they gave vent
to their rage by slaying the sick and non-combatants.
Our young friends suddenly found themselves surrounded
by furious Moslems swinging their scymitars
over their unprotected heads. Faithful to his
trust their care-taker sought to defend them, but
fell in the unequal contest, and the same fate seemed
to threaten them. A muscular, sun-browned hand
was already directing a blow at Raymond&rsquo;s head
with a blood-stained scymitar, but the blow was
averted by a sudden order. The enemies conversed
in a language the brothers did not understand, with
the result that their lives were spared, although they
were dragged away in spite of all resistance. They
were placed upon light, fleet horses, and, guarded
by a strong band of the enemy, left the camp, fleeing
afar with the wind&rsquo;s speed, they knew not whither.</p>
<p>They soon discovered that they had fallen into
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
the hands of the Sultan, and that it was he who had
rescued them from instant death. But alas! they
feared that they had only been spared to gratify
his revenge by some painful mode of torture. At
the same time it did not escape their notice how
carefully they were guarded from any possibility of
danger, and that great consideration was paid to the
wounded brother. They could not account for this,
nor could they reconcile such solicitude with the
malicious expression of the Sultan&rsquo;s face whenever
he looked at them. After a short halt, during
which the prisoners got some rest, they went on.
Though the night was very dark, Raymond noticed
that their way led through ravines and narrow defiles
like those in which the Christians had suffered
so many disasters. He had hoped to return that
way after the war was over, but, alas! how cruelly
was he disappointed! They were defenceless prisoners
in the hands of an enemy who knew no pity,
who blindly followed his relentless rage, and was
preparing to take their lives in the most barbarous
manner as an expiation for the thousands who had
been slain by the Christians.</p>
<p>Ready as he was to sacrifice his life for Christ and
His holy religion, Raymond would rather have
fallen, weapons in hand, fighting with the infidels,
the arch-enemies of Christianity, than perish by torture.
How he lamented the fatality of his wounded
arm! His effort to protect his father&rsquo;s life had
been in vain, and now he was a helpless prisoner.
His mind was filled with sad reflections in the stillness
of the night, broken only by the hoof-beats of
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
the horses.</p>
<p>The increasing coolness and light gray streaks in
the sky announced the approach of morning, and as
it gradually dawned he felt somewhat less anxious.
The same horde surrounded him, the same browned
faces scowled at him; but he could see the dear face
of his brother, and he felt cheered by his unwavering
reliance upon the will of God. This was a great
consolation, and they enjoyed it with all the ardor
of innocent souls. God&rsquo;s glorious nature lay spread
out before them, bathed in the morning radiance.
Millions of dewdrops glistened on the grass. The
flowers, refreshed by the moisture, exhaled delicious
fragrance, and thousands of the gentle singers of the
wood proclaimed their joy in song. When tears of
sadness came to their eyes at times, as they reflected
that the birds could enjoy a happiness denied to
them, they found consolation in the thought that
God cared for all his creatures, and that He would
not forget them. &ldquo;Not a sparrow falls from the
roof without the will of the Heavenly Father,&rdquo; say
the Scriptures.<a class="fn" id="fr_31" href="#fn_31">[31]</a> &ldquo;It is God&rsquo;s will that we suffer.
It is in accordance with His plans, and we must
submit. When His wise purpose is accomplished,
He will send us help.&rdquo; Thus Raymond consoled
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
his beloved brother.</p>
<p>The cool morning wind, which hardly stirred the
tree boughs, occasionally brought a peculiar roar to
their ears. Now it sounded strong, again weak;
at times it entirely ceased, and then was loud again.
The brothers thought it must come from some
distant spot at the end of their journey. They
strained their eyes to find it, but as soon as their
guards saw them doing this, they bandaged their
eyes. During the brief delay occasioned by this,
they noticed that the leader gave one of his attendants
an order, and that the latter hastily left in the
opposite direction.</p>
<p>The march was at once resumed. It was not
long before the roar grew stronger. The brothers
were convinced it was the noise of waves breaking
right and left along their way. &ldquo;The sea,&rdquo; thought
Raymond; &ldquo;we are by the sea, and no longer in
the interior of the enemy&rsquo;s country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon the horses clattered over a bridge and
halted in a spacious courtyard. The bandages
were removed, and the brothers found themselves
in a narrow space inclosed by high walls. Nothing
could be seen around them, but the beautiful clear
blue sky seemed to say, &ldquo;Despair not! God is
watching over you.&rdquo; They embraced each other
and heart to heart wept tears of sorrow and joy&mdash;of
sorrow over the death of their beloved father, of
joy that they still had each other and loved each
other so faithfully. Their joy was short-lived, however,
for they were soon led into a solitary room
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
and confined securely like ordinary prisoners.</p>
<p>They saw nothing of their enemy that day. A
grinning slave silently brought their simple food,
and after a time as silently carried away the dishes.
It seemed to the brothers that he was a mute, he
manifested so little interest in their conversation.</p>
<p>The prisoners naturally talked much about their
unfortunate plight,&mdash;what the Emperor would
think, and what great anxiety their absence would
cause him. At one moment they hoped he
would rescue them, but at the next they feared
he might be so occupied with his great undertaking
that he would find neither time nor opportunity to
come to their help. Possibly he might even forget
them in the wild tumult of war raging about him.
How could he be expected to think of their lives
when the lives of so many thousands depended
upon his activity? If their father were only living,
he would either attempt their rescue himself or
induce the Emperor to undertake it. The sad
thought brought tears to their eyes again.</p>
<p>After considering their situation from every point of
view, they continued to repose their trust in God, who
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
has so many agencies for the accomplishment of His
purposes. This reconciled them to the thought of
dying for the religion of Christ. Indeed, it seemed
to them now as glorious to sacrifice their lives within
prison walls as upon the battlefield. They shed tears
less often; their lips no longer uttered laments.</p>
<p>Thus the time passed for several days, but at
length the Sultan suddenly entered the room.
They instantly realized that they were not regarded
as ordinary prisoners. The Sultan inquired
if there was anything they needed, but they made
no complaints. He expected to see them at his
feet, deploring their situation, but he heard no
request for mitigation of their imprisonment, for
better food, or for the enjoyment of fresh air.
They were quiet and calm in his presence. Every
trace of sorrow had disappeared from their faces,
and confidence and courage shone in their eyes.
The Sultan stood before them, astonished at their
bearing. At last, with scornful look and menacing
voice, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your death will follow the slightest attempt
you make to escape, or which your Emperor shall
make to rescue you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall make no attempt to escape, for it is
impossible,&rdquo; said Raymond, &ldquo;but we cannot prevent
the Emperor from doing what he thinks is
right. If you kill us, we will die joyfully.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;But that will not be necessary, if your protector,
the Emperor, keeps his word as faithfully as they
say he does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He always keeps his word, whatever malicious
tongues may say to the contrary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, then, does he delay keeping it in your
case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know he has given his word
to us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oho! you innocent doves! On the very spot
where your father died, and where you (pointing to
Raymond) killed one of my bravest, I heard him
say, &lsquo;I will care for thy sons as if they were my
own, and I will pledge my life for them.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he will do what he said. He will keep
his word, but he has hardly had time to hear of
our capture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knows it well enough, but he will not keep
his word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is false.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so hasty! Listen. I have sent word
to him by one of my most trusty messengers that
you are in my hands and that I will kill you if he
attacks my castle. In addition to this, I offered to
release you if he would make peace and quit the
country. And what was his reply?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has considered your proposition, and rejects
it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;You have guessed right; and yet by doing as
he has done, he has put your lives in danger. He
has been faithless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He esteems honor&mdash;without which one cannot
be a knight&mdash;higher than life. Will he, the greatest
sovereign on earth, whose long life is one series
of heroic acts such as have rarely been performed
in this world, before whom Europe and Asia tremble,
will he forget his imperial duty and prove himself
guilty in his old age of such a cowardly act as you
expect from him? No, never! The world would
point its finger of scorn at him, and those who were
slain in executing his designs would rise up and say,
&lsquo;Thou hast deliberately sacrificed us at the close of
thy victorious career; thou hast thrown away all
that thou hast purchased with our blood.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sultan, astonished at these words, replied:
&ldquo;It is true the Emperor promised to free Palestine;
but he also promised to protect you, and his obstinacy
consigns you to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will die willingly when the time comes.
What we expected in battle we will not fly from in
prison, if God so wills. The Emperor knows our
feelings, and if he shall leave us to our fate, that
will be because he is engaged in carrying out a
higher purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps if you remind him of his pledge he will
recall the services of your father and accede to my
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
demands. Write to him, and a trusty messenger
shall take your letter to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never! It would be disgraceful for us to do
it. We would rather die a thousand times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing that his efforts were fruitless, the Sultan
contemptuously left the apartment. The brothers
now realized their importance in the eyes of the
enemy, and were satisfied that their noble father
would have approved what they had done.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Brothers&rsquo; Ordeal</span></h2>
<p>Evening had hardly fallen when the
Sultan again suddenly appeared in the
brothers&rsquo; room. He entered noiselessly
and regarded the two with a malicious
expression, as they stood arm in arm at the window
gazing at the glorious sunset, which seemed
to them a reflection of the infinite father-love of
God and awakened filial devotion for Him in their
hearts.</p>
<p>Their fearlessness surprised the Sultan. He had
hoped to find them downcast, and expected they
would tremble before him and prostrate themselves
at his feet. But nothing of this kind occurred.
They merely glanced at the intruder, then turned
their heads away and resumed their contemplation of
the sunset, as if he were some insignificant person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at the brilliant red which illuminates
half the sky,&rdquo; said Raymond, gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We see this every day and yet every day it
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
gives us the same delight,&rdquo; replied his brother.
&ldquo;How many times we have seen it with father
and mother from the windows of our castle! And
it was just as beautiful there as here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is because it is the work of the almighty
and all-gracious God, who has the same love for all
His earthly children. He overlooks none of them.
He cares alike for all, and although the needs of His
creatures are so different, yet He knows what each
one wants, and from His endless bounty He can
satisfy all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And does He also think of us?&rdquo; asked
Conrad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How canst thou ask such a question? Certainly
He does, foolish boy! He is everywhere,
and of course He is here. As He watches over
all He of course sees our condition and will help
us in His own good time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Raymond, you do not actually believe I
doubt what you say! I was only eager that this
imprisonment might soon end, so that thy wounded
arm might heal more quickly under the care of our
Christian brethren.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your liberty is in your own hands,&rdquo; interposed
the Sultan. &ldquo;Like two young fools, you have rejected
my proposal. Now I will renew it&mdash;write
to the Emperor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not one word,&rdquo; replied Raymond. &ldquo;We have
given you our answer, and we do not change our
minds like smooth-tongued Greeks and Turks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>The Sultan restrained his anger at the reproach
hurled at him, and addressed Conrad:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be more reasonable than your insolent brother.
You are young yet, but you know it is a sin against
God to shorten life. The Emperor will be forced
to free you. Write to him yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I well know it is a crime to take one&rsquo;s own life,
but it is also a crime to preserve that life by a shameful
deed. It would be the grossest offence to induce
the Emperor to abandon his high purposes by my
appeals for liberty. I refuse your request, as my
brother has done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wild rage flamed in the Sultan&rsquo;s eye, and his
face was distorted with unrestrained anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he roared, &ldquo;be it so! You shall now
feel my power. I have foolishly been considerate of
your youth, but shall be so no longer. You must
die,&mdash;that is a matter of course. But death will be
too mild a punishment for you. You have dared to
defy me, me whom millions obey! You shall now
suffer all that your brethren, the Christian dogs, have
suffered. I will inflict hunger, thirst, punishments
of every kind. I will devise tortures more painful
than any one before has ever imagined. While you
are enduring them your cries of agony will sound
like heavenly music in my ears. When you supplicate
for mercy there shall be no respite. The time
will have passed then for securing what I offer now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>With trembling voice&mdash;but not from fear&mdash;Conrad
replied: &ldquo;We have hitherto considered
you an honorable enemy. We do not complain
because you securely imprison us, but to treat us
as you have threatened to do lowers you to the
level of the savage beast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sultan somewhat regained his composure,
and left the room speechless from amazement at
their boldness.</p>
<p>The brothers again embraced, unmoved by his
horrible threat, and determined with God&rsquo;s help
to remain steadfast and not to deviate a finger&rsquo;s
breadth from the path of right and duty.</p>
<p>Their conversation was now disturbed by a
swarthy visaged person looking in at the door
and grimacing. He was a gigantic Turk, who
signified by gesture rather than by speech that
they were to follow him. They were a little
alarmed at first, but a glance at each other and
a mutual grasp of the hand reassured them, and
they courageously followed him. Their apprehensions,
however, were not realized. They were
simply changing the place of their confinement.
A low, dark room with small iron-grated windows
and bare walls, and destitute of the customary
furniture it was, where they were now to
spend their time. The slave left some wretched
food, and so slight an allowance of it that it barely
sufficed to relieve the pangs of hunger. They realized
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
by his conduct that he was their new keeper.</p>
<p>The change in their situation made little impression
upon them. The slave had hardly left the
room before they fell upon their knees, thanked
God that so far He had kept them from yielding,
and fervently prayed that He would continue to aid
them and save them from any severer trials.</p>
<p>Several days passed without affording them a sight
of their enemies. The miserable food did not allay
the cravings of hunger. The moisture trickling
down the walls, the damp, sticky atmosphere,
and the lack of refreshing rest nearly made them
ill. The slave&rsquo;s face manifested not a sign of
pity. On the contrary, the brothers thought
they noticed an expression of malicious satisfaction
whenever their eyes met his; but they
made no complaint.</p>
<p>One day, to their great astonishment, their keeper,
who seemed to have forgotten them, entered the
room bringing dainty food instead of the usual
prison fare. A hot rice soup steamed from a
clean dish, regaling the senses and tempting the
appetite. The slave&rsquo;s conduct was also different.
A look of sympathy had taken the place of his
scornful smile. He invited them to partake of
the food, and placed it before them himself, in
the most friendly manner, for they were afraid
to take it, suspecting that it was only offered to
them in malicious mockery. But when he went
out and returned with a pair of roasted fowls,
they no longer distrusted him or hesitated to
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
accept his repeated invitations.</p>
<p>The slave waited upon the table with as much
ceremony as if he were serving distinguished company,
now helping one, then the other, and urging
both to take more. They ate with gratitude to God
for making such a change in their master&rsquo;s heart,
but made no conversation with the servant, though
he evidently was expecting them to do so. Indeed,
the meal closed without a word from them, though
the Turk coughed and hemmed and made every
sort of hint to them, hoping they would speak.
At last he withdrew, but speedily returned with
a tankard. &ldquo;Here is something to warm Christian
hearts,&rdquo; he said with a smile, as if confident
they would at last break their silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wine?&rdquo; said Conrad. &ldquo;I thought the Turks
did not drink wine. What does the Sultan mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though Conrad was only speaking to his brother,
the servant answered: &ldquo;The Sultan? This wine
is not from him. It is from Rustan, your servant,
young gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean you have done this without the
Sultan&rsquo;s knowledge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As sure as I am Rustan. But, by Allah,
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
the Sultan does not and must not know a word
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys looked at each other in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not be alarmed, dear young gentlemen,&rdquo;
said Rustan. &ldquo;You shall know all. Look you!
old Rustan loves the Christians though he is a
Mussulman. When I was a young man I bravely
fought them, for I was incited by the dervishes, the
bloodthirsty enemies of your faith. I was wounded,
taken prisoner, and nursed by a Christian in his
home. I have never forgotten it. I have never
fought against them since. Fate brought me to
this castle and made me your keeper. The Sultan
forced me to treat you harshly. It broke my
heart to see you suffering, and I have improved the
first opportunity to make you some amends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both the brothers were greatly moved by his
story, and believed they were doing right to accept
his proffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, drink,&rdquo; said the Turk. &ldquo;It is pure
Cyprus, which, as I have heard, is much esteemed
by the Franks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After considerable persuasion the prisoners drank,
and the excellent, strong wine refreshed them.
Rustan urged them to take some more, but they
declined. They restrained their desires as usual,
for they well knew that much wine was not wholesome
for those so young. They were satisfied with
what was reasonable, and this had always been the
habit of their lives.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic3">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="737" />
<p class="caption"><i>The Test</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>Rustan improved his opportunity, and while repeatedly
lamenting their hard lot, he informed them
they must attempt to free themselves, for they could
expect no mercy from the Sultan, who had sworn by
the beard of the Prophet to punish their insolence.
&ldquo;No Mussulman, least of all Kilidj Arslan, ever
breaks this oath,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;therefore, fly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is easier said than done,&rdquo; replied Raymond,
&ldquo;and you, Rustan, know even better than
we do how impossible it is to escape from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will find the way for you. Like you, I
suffered greatly before you came. Then, as your
keeper, I was forced to be cruel to you. My old
head cannot invent cruelties, and my back has to
suffer for it. I have had enough of cruelty; I will
escape with you. Come and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rustan took the boys by the hands and led them
quietly down a long corridor. They followed him
involuntarily, but without a tremor. At last they
came to a door opening upon a handsome apartment
with a gorgeous tapestry dividing it in the
centre. Behind it the Sultan was soundly sleeping
upon silken cushions with curtains undrawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see escape is possible. The tyrant who
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
tortures you and me is fast asleep. He will not be
awakened, for woe to him who disturbs his rest.
The castle garrison is an insignificant one. I know
all the passages and have the keys of the gate leading
to the causeway. Put on Turkish costumes,
and in a trice you will be out, and we will fly to the
Emperor&rsquo;s camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The temptation to escape came so suddenly that
the boys were inclined to yield to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said Rustan, &ldquo;we are not absolutely
safe even when the tyrant sleeps. When he wakes,
his first question will be about you, for even in sleep
he dreams of you and is busy devising new tortures.
So, if you would be absolutely safe, take this dagger
and thrust it into the heart of your torturer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words he placed a sharp, polished
dagger into the hand of each of the boys in spite
of their resistance. All at once they felt these
glittering but fearful weapons in their hands. To
secure their liberty they must make no noise, scarce
venture a word of reply, to say nothing of dropping
the daggers. Their dangerous situation alarmed
them. They would rather have remained in their
gloomy prison. Rustan, however, was both deaf and
blind to their evident signs of abhorrence of such a
shameful deed. They attempted to leave the apartment
but he prevented them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall not leave here until you have disposed
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
of that tyrant&rsquo;s accursed life. I supposed you were
brave sons of a brave father,&rdquo; he craftily whispered,
&ldquo;but you are cowards, and incapable of bold deeds.
As I will not return to the yoke of the slave or die
a miserable death with you, when we are discovered,
I will risk it alone.&rdquo; Drawing a dagger, he advanced
upon the sleeping Sultan with the intention
of stabbing him, but Raymond rushed between them
and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not the custom of knights to kill a sleeping,
defenceless enemy. We will fight for our
liberty with the same weapons, man to man. You
shall reach him only over our dead bodies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awake!&rdquo; cried Conrad, vigorously shaking the
Sultan. &ldquo;Awake! your life is in danger. An
assassin threatens you. Take this dagger and protect
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sultan roused up. Raymond was still holding
Rustan&rsquo;s dagger arm and with his wounded arm
holding his own dagger at his heart, while Conrad
was standing in a threatening attitude by the side of
the Sultan and looking at the assassin with blazing
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep these daggers as souvenirs from me,&rdquo; said
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
the awakened Sultan. &ldquo;I shall not forget this hour.
I have heard and seen all. You are brave and
honest boys, and have well stood the test I arranged.
From now on you will be released from prison;
but I cannot give you your liberty, because I must
avail myself of every agency to make a lasting peace
with your Emperor. But I will treat you as my
sons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sultan then left the apartment, which was
next to his own, so that it might be put in order for
them, and that they should be near him. Rustan,
who had played his role so masterfully, was again
the Sultan&rsquo;s old faithful servant, and as such was
doubly dear to the boys.</p>
<p>Life was now far different. Many would have
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
highly enjoyed it, and felt happy amid such good
living, handsome surroundings, and abundance of
everything, and have soon forgotten their old conditions.
But it was not so with the brothers. They
could hardly forget the Emperor for a moment, and
they nearly always spoke of him when they were
alone. Their desire for liberty was still strong, and
though they scorned to secure it by such a horrible
deed as murder, yet they would have followed
Rustan&rsquo;s lead if he could have freed them in any
way but that. They were convinced that their
steadfastness in the right course would result in
greater advantage to them, as well as to the Christian
army, than an act of murder when they were
still too young and inexperienced to unravel the
web of the cunning Turk and see through his plans.
They had earned his respect&mdash;the respect of an
enemy second to none in the world. Since he respected
them, he certainly would respect the knights
and, above all, the Emperor, for he was the ideal
of all knightly virtues. What might have been
their fate if, urged on by the unchristian thirst for
revenge, and forgetful of their duty, they had attempted
to use the murderous steel? Both Rustan
and the Sultan would have confronted them, and
against two such foes two weak boys would have
been powerless. Even if they had overcome them
and secured their liberty, the deed would not have
been approved in the camp, and they would have
been held in contempt all their lives. Though
their noble course was unknown to the Emperor
and Christendom, though it dissipated their hope
of rescue, and they might have to pass their young
lives in a lonesome castle, there was One who had
seen their act and had tested their hearts. God
would not let it pass unrequited.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Emperor to the Rescue</span></h2>
<p>We left the Emperor fighting furiously
in the streets of Iconium. Where
the danger was greatest he fought
with the bravery always characteristic
of him. None could withstand him. They either
fell before his vigorous attacks, or fled as fast and
far as their feet could take them. The Christians
were equally bold even when the Turks assailed
them with the fierceness of lions. Their bitter resentment
over broken faith, their remembrance of
the sufferings they had undergone, the thought of
so many fallen comrades, and their unwavering belief
that the destruction of the enemies of Christianity
was pleasing to God, inflamed them to a
pitch of fury that extinguished every spark of humanity.
They did not desist until every turban-wearer
was killed or, like the Sultan, fortunate
enough to make his escape. The Emperor was one
of the last to sheathe his reddened sword. Many
fell utterly exhausted, for in the excitement of the
battle they had not noticed their waning strength.
The foot-soldiers, who had driven stakes into the
ground to protect themselves from the enemy&rsquo;s
cavalry charges, were hardly able to move. In addition
to an immense amount of spoils and the wealth
of the city, they secured an abundance of subsistence.
All who were able procured enough for
themselves and for the needs of their exhausted
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
comrades.</p>
<p>After the Emperor&rsquo;s work was complete, and in
the midst of his exultation over his victory and the
fruits of his conquest of the city, he first learned
what he had lost in the meantime. He could
hardly trust his ears when he was informed of the
capture of his wards. After repeated assurances
that the news was true, and that their faithful caretaker
had been found dead, the Emperor&rsquo;s cheeks
paled and his flashing eyes dimmed, for he realized
at once the impending fate of the unfortunate lads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could not have struck me a harder blow
than this, cruel Sultan,&rdquo; he said, grimly. &ldquo;You
were cunning enough to know how dear those boys
are to me. A fine proof of your courage this is,
you coward, who shun open battle face to face,
who can only succeed with overwhelming numbers,
who lie in wait and strike your foeman in the
back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The glory of his victory was dimmed for him.
The spoils he had won lost all their value in his
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
eyes. This was no more than he had often done.
But how should he redeem his knightly word, which
never yet had been broken? He had allowed himself
to be deceived by a subtle enemy, to whom
he had exposed the boys, fancying them secure
even when not under his watchful eye, and the result
might be fatal to those who had trusted to his
protection.</p>
<p>His associates vainly tried to convince him he
had not been guilty of any neglect of duty. Empty
words could not comfort him. &ldquo;It has all happened
because of my negligence,&rdquo; he replied. His
first move was to order immediate pursuit of the
enemy, in the hope of rescuing the boys.</p>
<p>The most devoted of his knights mounted steeds
they had captured, and set off in pursuit of the fugitives,
believing that the latter, after the long day&rsquo;s
battle, could not have gone any considerable distance.
They returned shortly, however, bringing
with them a messenger sent by the Sultan to the
Emperor. He was at once taken before him, and
announced that the two boys were in the Sultan&rsquo;s
power, and that the latter well knew how dear the
sons of the Emperor&rsquo;s old friend were to him, as
well as the promise he had made to that friend in
his dying moments. He further announced that
the Sultan would engage to return them if the Emperor
would give up the spoils he had captured, as
well as the Sultan&rsquo;s possessions. If the Emperor
refused the proposal, the boys should die in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
strong castle by the sea the moment he attacked it.</p>
<p>The messenger&rsquo;s announcement caused general
astonishment. When the first shock of the blow
had passed, however, the Emperor&rsquo;s eyes gleamed
with exultant determination. His very soul revolted
against such a proposal, and his anger against
the Sultan for expecting him to accede to it was
furious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell your prince,&rdquo; he exclaimed in thunder
tones, &ldquo;tell your prince I spurn his proposal. My
imperial honor will not allow me to release my
wards in such a manner. By God&rsquo;s grace, I will
keep my word, but I will not surrender the fruits
of a victory purchased with the blood of thousands.
No! with God&rsquo;s help, I will find some way to redeem
my promise becoming to a hero and an Emperor.
Tell the Sultan I will hold him responsible
with his head for the safety of my boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words the Emperor turned his back
upon the messenger. All present applauded the
reply of the old hero. Though none had believed
he would accept the Sultan&rsquo;s terms, they had
thought it possible that the Emperor might open
negotiations, and, if possible, reach a settlement
without bloodshed. They feared any such arrangement,
as it would only secure them a fickle-minded
and unreliable friend; and should conditions arise
at any time like those they had found in their dealings
with the Greeks, they would never be certain
whether he was their friend or their enemy. Every
step they took would be hindered, and their plans
might be entirely frustrated. But since the Emperor
had replied in such a decisive manner, and the messenger&rsquo;s
departure from the city would end all negotiations,
they knew to a certainty that they now had
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
to deal with an enemy.</p>
<p>The Germans remained in Iconium an entire
week. The houses were filled with wounded who
had to be cared for, and this duty was all the more
imperative because of the lack of doctors. The
knights and their attendants were so well skilled in
the treatment of wounds that they were of great
service; but in the cases of those who had been
overcome by their strenuous exertions, and weakened
for want of proper food, the wounds were exceedingly
dangerous; and, besides, the danger was
aggravated by the heat. The natives could not be
trusted; hence every one had to depend upon the
love of his Christian neighbor; and if ever this
most beautiful doctrine of Christianity was practised,
it was there. Proud knights who governed
hundreds at home, cared for all their faithful attendants,
even for the sons of the lowest of their vassals;
and sometimes those who had been accustomed to
wealth and splendor, and perhaps had been hard
rulers, waited upon the meanly born. Again, some
knight nursed another of equal station who, before
they espoused the cause of the Cross, had been his
mortal enemy and might then have been attacking
him or burning his castle, had they not ceased
their strife to go to the rescue of Christians in
the Orient. Such were the extraordinary scenes
among these warriors whose swords were still red
with Turkish blood. But a moment ago they were
fierce as lions and tigers; now they were as gentle
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">143</span>
as lambs.</p>
<p>The Emperor was omnipresent. He had room
in his heart for every one in his service. He consoled
many an old comrade lying on his bed of
pain. He closed many an eye which had watched
for him and with him. He held many a cold hand
which had wielded the sword for him, and tears of
sympathy often came to his eyes. Then he turned
to the well who were enjoying rest in the plazas and
streets of the city, and cleaning their weapons and
armor; or he visited the sentinels on the walls to
see if they were faithful to their duties. While
there, his eyes involuntarily turned to the spot where
he thought the castle stood in which his boys were
prisoners. Notwithstanding they were far away, he
strained his eyes as if to find out their condition
and to read in their faces whether they still confided
in him, or whether, like their present master, they
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
doubted his word.</p>
<p>The Emperor gave long consideration to the
means at his command for effecting their rescue,
but none of them appeared practicable. One thing
was certain. If an attack were made upon his really
impregnable castle the Sultan would carry out his
threat. Then again of what use would it be
to capture the castle, even if it were possible?
They could not catch the Sultan and bring him to
account so long as they could not cut off his escape
by sea. As for negotiation, the Emperor gave it
no thought. He was certain that the Sultan
would not make a second offer; and even if he
found that the Emperor was willing to listen, he
felt sure that he not only would repeat the old demands
but probably would add new and not less
ignominious ones.</p>
<p>From every point of view the deed was almost
superhuman. The castle could be approached only
by land, over a narrow causeway, which was in
plain sight and could be easily defended. But even
if they crossed it without resistance, they would
come to portcullises which could be easily lowered
so as to cut them off and ensure their destruction.
Seawards a large inclosure was filled with most
trustworthy guards&mdash;a number of huge and powerful
lions, tigers, and panthers, whose loud roars
were terrible enough to prevent any one from
attempting to scale the wall on that side. But
even supposing a knight were found ready to
attempt this rash exploit, what could be accomplished?
Could he rescue the boys from the
Sultan and escape with them past the castle garrison?
And if he failed what would become of the
Emperor&rsquo;s promise? Would he have risked his
life for them as he agreed? He would have
done no more than any other might have done and
the faithless Turk would have laughed at him for
his pains. Frederick&rsquo;s honor had thus far been
unquestioned. His word was of more worth
than gold. He could not escape the conclusion
that to uphold his honor to the last he must undertake
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
the deed alone.</p>
<p>This thought flashed through his mind like the
lightning. A knight in every sense of the word,
as his whole life had shown, Frederick had all the
virtues of true knighthood in their highest development.
In his time knighthood was not satisfied
with ordinary dangers. It sought for daring exploits,
and purposely invited and magnified them
that victory might be all the more glorious. It was
regarded as a misfortune that the world no longer
swarmed with dragons and serpents, with which,
according to the legends, the heroes of the olden
time contended. Giants and goblins had also
disappeared, and the knightly heroes therefore
eagerly seized the opportunity to encounter dangers
in the Orient they had never faced before, and
to overcome them and thereby display their knighthood
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
as well as their religious enthusiasm.</p>
<p>No exploit more dangerous than that which
Frederick decided to perform could have been conceived.
He industriously made plans to reach the
Sultan, rejecting this and that, until but one remained.
He must risk that, and no other. But
in the meantime how could he attend to his other
duties? His army certainly was safe from any
immediate attack by the Turks. But did the Sultan
actually expect that his proposal would be
accepted? Probably, otherwise he would have been
more actively engaged. But what would happen
in case he, the Emperor, failed in this dangerous
undertaking? In that case, if his army were
attacked, his name would no longer be a terror to
the enemy, and still, with so many valiant knights
in the army, it would not lack for a leader. His
son, inheritor of his name and his virtues, now in
the very flower of youthful strength and courage,
would lead it to victory, with God&rsquo;s help, as he had
done.</p>
<p>The evening star was shining serenely on the
horizon when the Emperor completed his plans.
He determined there should be no further delay.
What was to be done must be done quickly. He
went to his son, Frederick of Swabia, frankly laid
his plans before him, assigned him to the chief command
of the army, and requested him to keep his
absence a secret, so that it should not have a disquieting
effect upon the army. If he did not return
in three days he instructed him to attack the
Turkish castle by the sea with all his strength, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
look for him there.</p>
<p>Night had enveloped the city in thick darkness
when the Emperor, disguised in plain costume,
passed through the gate leading to the south. With
his armor and cloak securely packed upon his
horse, he rode through the ranks of the sleeping
army. Now and then a sentinel challenged him, but
he was not halted as he well knew the watchword.
He had very wisely selected one of those horses
which could be relied upon to cover a long distance
in a short time, and which in battle were accustomed
to carry heavy armor in case their riders were
exhausted.</p>
<p>Reaching the open country, the noble animal flew
along with the ease and speed characteristic of
Oriental steeds. There was no obstruction in his
way, no enemy in sight. They seemed to have
vanished as completely as if the wind had swept
them away. His way now stretched over luxurious
grassy plains, now through gloomy mountain
forests. Many miles lay behind him, but his steed
seemed as fresh as at the start, and the Emperor
himself was but little wearied. The fresh night air,
the pleasure of the ride, and the thought that at
last he would redeem his word inspired him with
more enthusiasm than he had felt at any time since
the loss of the boys. He rode to face danger as
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
exultantly as if he were faring to a tournament.</p>
<p>In the early gray of the morning the Emperor
came to a solitary fisherman&rsquo;s hut, which showed no
sign of life within. Evidently it was either deserted
or its owner was sleeping. He was now sure he
was in the vicinity of the castle. He knocked at
the door and waited long for admission. He soon
grew impatient and had just decided to break down
the weak door and wait inside until daylight; or if
he found the occupant had been afraid to open it, to
take him along as a guide. A person looked out of
the little window, but instantly drew back as if in
fear when he saw the knight. Frederick espied
him and demanded admission.</p>
<p>After considerable delay the fisherman opened
the door. He suddenly appeared to have recovered
from his fright, for he received the knight very
hospitably, brought him food, placed it upon the
table, and begged his guest to partake. &ldquo;I would
gladly offer you more, brave knight; but I am
poor, and this is all I have.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;Make no excuses, my good man,&rdquo; replied
Frederick. &ldquo;I am not so satiated that I need to
have luxuries. I have been living on simple fare
for several days, and have become quite accustomed
to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are the Christians reduced to their old straits
again?&rdquo; asked the fisherman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, thanks to the Greeks and Turks. They
have proved alike unfaithful. Your Greek Christians
have broken their word again, and would have
been open enemies had they not been afraid of the
brave Germans. Your master, the Sultan, has been
worse than any of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But his subjects ought not to be held responsible
for his offences. They say your Emperor is
a powerful sovereign, but mild and conciliatory
also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had been with him daily you could not
have described him more accurately, but neither
your people nor your Sultan should presume upon
his gentle disposition too far. It has bounds.
The entire country is now subdued. The enemy
has fled, and the Sultan has taken refuge in his
castle by the sea. Tell me, do you know anything
about that place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Sir Knight, I can inform you about it
if you wish to know. Come here! Look! there
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
are its walls with towers overtopping them. You
can recognize them though it is not yet day. The
Sultan is staying there now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, oh, no! The garrison is not strong, but
the castle is by no means empty. I will tell you,
but in confidence, that the Sultan keeps two boy-prisoners
there who are very dear to the Emperor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen them?&rdquo; said the Emperor, with
much excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet; but I heard of them when I was there
selling fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the Emperor, with an air of indifference,
not wishing to betray himself, for he observed
that the fisherman was watching him curiously.
&ldquo;Does the Sultan keep no guards about him because
he has no fear that the Emperor will attack
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir, he is safe against all the armies in the
world! I ought not to reveal this to you, for the
Sultan is my master; but believe me, I have so
much respect for your Emperor that I am willing
to do him or one of his knights a service. The
castle is strongly protected. It cannot be taken
from the land side, and seawards it is skirted by an
inclosure filled with savage beasts. Oh, sir! I
have now and then seen those cruel animals from
a distance, and been terribly frightened by their
dreadful roars. When I have seen them spring
upon one another in mighty leaps, though they
were only in sport, it has scared me so that I have
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
seized my oars and rowed far from the spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You timorous hare! Do you suppose a German
knight fears to go among those beasts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fisherman stared at the knight in astonishment.
&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, Sir Knight, do not think
of going there. No prisoner who has tried to escape
that way has ever come out alive. They could
hardly find his bones in the morning, and sometimes
only a few blood spots told the story of his
awful death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can a prisoner get in there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Near the centre of the enclosure there is a door
which remains closed, but unlocked, day and night.
A passage from it leads to the lion tower where the
prisoners are. You can see it rising from the centre
of the castle. They say that the guards sometimes
pay no attention to their prisoners, because they
know that if they seek to escape through this passage
they will meet an awful death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Emperor&rsquo;s blood ran cold as the thought
occurred to him that the Sultan might take the
same course with the boys, but he quickly regained
his composure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Promise me, Sir Knight, not to throw away
your life there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fool, where did you get that idea? If I wished
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
to go there I should not hesitate, for I should expect
to succeed; but I don&rsquo;t know that I have any
interest over there. Find me a quiet little place
where I can sleep a few hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fisherman promptly replied: &ldquo;No one will
disturb you here, for no one else lives here. Lie
down anywhere and rest. I am going to look for
firewood, and shall not be back until it is time to
get dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many thanks to you, but go as soon as you
can, so that I can sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Barbarossa&rsquo;s Victory and Death</span></h2>
<p>The Emperor thoroughly understood the
friendly solicitude of his host. He had
had large experience with Greek treachery
in little as well as in great affairs. He
was well aware that their greed and their hatred of
the Western Christians would lead them to work
against him at every opportunity. It was easy
enough to protect himself against the fisherman&rsquo;s
hostile designs by killing him or by putting him
in safe custody until his work was accomplished,
but he regarded such action as ungrateful, cowardly,
and vile. He knew also that he could purchase
the man&rsquo;s faithfulness, but he would not debase
himself so far as to redeem his pledge by the use of
gold. He must rely, therefore, upon his own resources.
He decided to make no further concealment
of his purpose, but at the same time to be
cautious about revealing his identity. He would
defeat any treacherous act the fisherman might be
contemplating, by prompt action, and at the same
time astonish his enemy by the boldness of his
exploit, whether he succeeded or perished in the attempt.
He quickly made his plan and lost no
time in putting it into execution, for the moment
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
was favorable.</p>
<p>Quickly donning his armor, helmet, and cloak,
he stepped out of the hut. A little boat was dancing
on the gentle waves, and a light wind was blowing
toward the castle. &ldquo;Everything is propitious,&rdquo;
he said to himself, delightedly; &ldquo;now to my work
with God&rsquo;s help.&rdquo; He sprang into the boat, seized
the oar, and rowed as deftly as if he were an oarsman
by occupation.</p>
<p>The sun was already high and beat down upon
our seaman scorchingly. Great drops of perspiration
ran down his face, for he was unused to the
work, and his armor made it all the more laborious;
but he did not lessen his efforts. Now and then
he would let the boat glide along of its own motion,
and then, resuming the oar, send it ahead with still
more vigorous strokes.</p>
<p>Gradually he neared the castle, which seemed to
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
emerge from the waves of the sea in all its hugeness
of outline. Looking up, he surveyed the imposing
and colossal work of human industry. With practised
eye he estimated the strength and height of
towers and walls, as well as the size of the enclosure,
and tried to ascertain the exact locality of the door
leading from it. The sight before him and the
magnitude of the task, which seemed to transcend
human ability, might well have induced him to
abandon his attempt; but a voice within him said:
&ldquo;Thy pledged word is sacred. Duty calls thee.
It is no time for fear or doubt. Courage and
presence of mind alone will aid thee.&rdquo; He studied
the situation and planned out his method of attack
with the same coolness and composure that characterized
him when laying out his movements on
the battlefield. His hand had not trembled, his
heart had not wavered in a hundred battles. It
beat undauntedly when all seemed lost at Legnano,
and in many a desperate battle with the Turks.
Why, then, should it beat less resolutely in a contest
which must decide in a moment whether victory
or death was to be his fate?</p>
<p>It was a little past midday when our hero reached
the castle. The beasts at that time should have
been in deep sleep, but to his astonishment they
were restlessly moving about. From time to time
they ran growling toward the centre of the enclosure
as if pursued by some stronger animal.
Then they would go back to their resting-places,
but without showing any disposition to sleep.
Then, yawning frightfully and eagerly licking
their lips, they would spring up and rush about
again with wildly gleaming eyes.</p>
<p>The Emperor had not expected such conduct
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
from the beasts, and the thought occurred to him,
Is it due to something besides mere chance? Has
the fisherman actually carried out his treacherous
design? It seemed likely to him. He had to
admit to himself that the danger arising from such
a consideration might prove fatal; but even were
it so, he decided to carry out the plan which he had
fixed upon, as the best under the circumstances.</p>
<p>He approached the sea-washed wall as noiselessly
as he could, so as not to attract the attention of the
beasts. Bending low, he drove the boat ahead with
short, quick strokes until he reached it; then, laying
down his oar, he examined his sword and dagger,
fastened his cloak loosely about his broad shoulders,
clutched the rail running along the wall: a step, a
spring, and he was up.</p>
<p>Not an instant elapsed before he was in the enclosure,
confronting the savage beasts. He realized
at the first glance the full extent of his danger, and
decided what to do. He discerned the trap-door at
once and with drawn sword in his right hand rushed
to it. At the same instant the beasts noticed him.
The lithe, bloodthirsty monsters emerged from their
lairs at once and advanced upon him in swift leaps.
A large panther outstripped them all. He reached
the Emperor from the left side in two bounds, followed
closely by a huge lion from the right. Being
still three paces away from the trap-door, a fearful
struggle was unavoidable, for either of those terrible
animals would have been a formidable foe for one
man.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic4">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="" width="749" height="1000" />
<p class="caption"><i>Redbeard and the Lion.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>With the quickness of lightning the Emperor
plunged his sword into the lion&rsquo;s breast, at the
same time tearing his cloak from his shoulders
with his left hand and throwing it over the panther&rsquo;s
head. The hope of victory shone in the
Emperor&rsquo;s face; his most cruel enemy was harmless
for the moment. Unopposed by him he advanced
to the trap-door in the midst of numerous
smaller but hardly less dangerous beasts seeking to
pounce upon him, each in his own way. As the
Emperor stooped to raise the trap-door, a leopard
sprang over him and another was thrown back by
the lifting of the trap-door, the panther still being
enveloped in the cloak. All this took but an instant,
but in that instant the Emperor sprang into
a dark passage and the door closed down behind
him.</p>
<p>Our hero waited only long enough to make sure
that he had securely fastened the door on the inside,
for overhead there was a bedlam of roars and growls
as if all the beasts of Asia and Africa were loose there.
The shrieks and snarls of the smaller mingled with
the heavy roars of the larger beasts. Sharp claws
scratched on the door, and the animals tore at it
and hurled themselves against it so furiously that
it seemed as if they would burst it open, and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">158</span>
whole cruel pack fall upon the bold hero.</p>
<p>Victor over the wild animals, he must now prove
himself victor over human ones. The Emperor
proceeded steadily but cautiously. With sword in
hand he tested the floor of the passage lest he
should stumble into some pitfall. He also carefully
felt the walls to see if there were any side
passages from which he might be attacked in the
rear. He found none, and at last came to a door.
There were several cracks in this door, but not a
gleam of daylight penetrated through them. The
passage also grew wider. Fearing it might lead
under the castle and thence out into the open air
again, he calculated the distance from the door in
the enclosure to the castle. He was now sure that
the second door must open directly into the castle,
and the masonry on the right and left confirmed his
judgment. With the help of his sword he forced
the door open. He advanced a few steps and, to
his infinite astonishment, saw the Sultan sitting
immediately before him with a numerous and brilliant
suite, and the two boys, Raymond and Conrad,
on either side of him. Amazement and defiance
were visible on every face. The Emperor was
overcome with surprise. The silence grew so intense
and painful that every one could hear his own
heart beat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>The Sultan at last broke the silence:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bid thee welcome to my castle, thou great
hero.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A heavy burden was lifted from every heart.
Anxiety gave way to pleasant anticipation as the
Sultan continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have no fear that I shall abuse the power which
thy boldness has given me. I am disarmed, not by
terror of thy name, which has made my bravest
tremble, but by thine indomitable courage of arm
and lofty magnanimity of soul. I will henceforth
be thine ally; and as a pledge of my faith I give
thee thy dear ones. They are worthy of thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frederick was deeply moved. His beloved boys
fervently embraced him. They called him their
rescuer and second father, and then turned and
warmly expressed their gratitude to the Sultan.
Frederick cordially extended his hand to the
generous Turk and the alliance was made.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Sultan joyfully conducted his
noble guest to magnificent apartments on the upper
floor of the castle, where everything conducive to
his comfort was provided. The servants were
ordered to bring the best of food and drink at once.
The great rooms of the castle, which had been so
empty and desolate, were now full of good cheer.
Frederick listened with lively satisfaction to the
story of the chivalrous action of the boys; and
the Sultan in telling it did not omit to mention
his threats and promises and cruel tests. The
Emperor closely embraced the boys, and when the
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
Sultan had finished his story, said to them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;With God&rsquo;s help you have accomplished one
of the hardest of tasks. You have secured more
respect for the Christian name than I have done
with the sword. Henceforth Turks will have a
different opinion of us, and this is due to your
noble achievement with the simple weapons of Christianity&mdash;love
of virtue, love of your enemy. God&rsquo;s
blessing will rest upon such Christian warriors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The details of the alliance were soon settled.
The Emperor willingly gave up the spoils he had
captured, and the Sultan promised to be a faithful
ally in the future, to assist the Emperor with troops
against Saladin, and to furnish plenty of subsistence.
Rustan was ordered to take his swiftest horse, ride
to Iconium and carry the joyful news to the army
and the citizens. He accomplished his errand with
an alacrity which proved how overjoyed he was
himself at the happy outcome of the situation.</p>
<p>After a few days the Emperor took leave of his
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">161</span>
friendly host. Before he left he went to look at
the animal enclosure. Holding his boys by the
hand, he looked down upon the spot of the terrible
encounter, where his first assailant, the huge
panther, was now king of the savage pack, for the
Emperor had disposed of his predecessor, the lion.
The boys looked down apprehensively from their
secure position, but the Emperor was exultant over
the memories of victory. They repeatedly expressed
their gratitude to him, but he only pointed
upward, saying that their thanks were due to Him
who controls all human destinies.</p>
<p>The three now left the castle upon the fleetest
horses in the Sultan&rsquo;s stables, gifts from him to
his new friends. Their steeds flew over the long,
narrow causeway toward the spot where the army
awaited them. Escorted by a strong guard, they
took a shorter route, known to the natives, and
were at their journey&rsquo;s end in an incredibly short
time.</p>
<p>The towers of Iconium were hardly in sight
before the roads were crowded with those who
could not wait to welcome the Emperor and tender
him their joyful congratulations. The nearer
they came to the city the greater was the rejoicing.
Shouts and cries of welcome from Christians and
Turks alike followed him to his quarters in the
city; and when in sight of the army and the
whole city he conferred the honor of knighthood
upon the two boys, it seemed as if the enthusiastic
shouts would never cease, for every one had heard
their story from the lips of Rustan.</p>
<p>The Emperor at once resumed his duties.
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">162</span>
Astonishment mingled with admiration was everywhere
aroused as the news of his heroic achievement
and the new alliance spread through the country. It
also made a deep impression upon Saladin and his
army. Frederick decided to secure victory or peace
before the enthusiasm of his army and the astonishment
of the enemy had subsided. He hoped to
win over Saladin also, for he knew he was a nobler
enemy than Kilidj Arslan had been. But he was
deceived in the expectation that he could accomplish
it without a battle. Saladin, perhaps the
noblest sovereign in the East since Mohammed&rsquo;s
time, besides being high-minded, noble-hearted, and
a lover of justice and humanity, was also a very brave
and warlike ruler and a devoted follower of the
Prophets. He was called the Eastern Barbarossa.
Thus far he had fought only against Christians,
whom he despised because of their conduct and
their faithlessness with each other. He had openly
expressed his contempt for the weak Guido of Lusignan,
King of Jerusalem, and especially for the
Templars and Knights of St. John, who had been
treacherous to each other in violation of their
vows<a class="fn" id="fr_32" href="#fn_32">[32]</a>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>The struggle began as soon as the Christian army
entered Syria. They were in position on one side
of the insignificant Kalykadnos or Saleph River;
on the other side the enemy was awaiting attack.
The Christians at once began building a bridge.
They were continually harassed by the arrows and
javelins of the enemy, but they did not desist. On
the contrary they worked persistently hours at a
time.</p>
<p>The old Emperor, however, became impatient.
As boldly as if the blood of youth were still
coursing in his veins, he plunged into the river
and tried to swim to the other shore. But he
who had overcome so many dangers, many of
them far greater than this, now met his doom.
A stroke of apoplexy ended that life so rich in
glorious deeds. He had escaped the sharp Lombard
dagger, the poisoned Saracen arrow, and the
tiger&rsquo;s cruel tooth, to lose his life in the sluggish
waters of the river Saleph, the name of which was
hardly known beyond its banks.</p>
<p>Words cannot describe the sorrow of the Christian
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
host. With Frederick, an army perished. The
world had trembled at his name and the Orient had
been terrified by it. Now he who bore this name
was a corpse. His once strong arm was powerless.
His once bold heart was still. They took him from
the water, stark and cold. He would no longer terrify
those enemies, who exulted as if they and not
the cold waves of the river had killed their great
adversary.</p>
<p>After the first shock of sorrow the Christians
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">165</span>
attacked the enemy with all their power. Frederick
of Swabia, the Emperor&rsquo;s son, led them,
but after some minor successes, the greater part
of them succumbed to the superior numbers of
this foe, and the effects of the climate. Of that
well-equipped army of ninety-five thousand men
only about five thousand were left. Starvation
swept away many of those who escaped the
Turkish scymitars, and those who escaped both
fell victims to strange malignant diseases and
lack of care. The Templars and the Knights
of St. John had many hospitals, which they had
built and which were maintained by contributions
from all over Europe; but they never asked the
sick if they were Christians, but if they were Englishmen
or Frenchmen. The Germans were not
received. Many a German heart at home was
touched with pity at the unspeakable suffering of
so many of their people, and was filled with indignation,
at such unchristian conduct; others busily
engaged themselves in plans for relief. The merchants
of Bremen gave the sails of their vessels to
be made into tents for the sick Germans. Knights
who had been in life-long struggle with the Saracens
closed their glorious careers by imitating the example
of the merciful Samaritan. They organized an order
for the care of the sick, similar to those of the Templars
and the Knights of St. John.<a class="fn" id="fr_33" href="#fn_33">[33]</a>
were permitted to become members, but its charitable
ministrations were offered to all nationalities. Frederick
of Swabia gladly gave his assent to the pious
work and did his utmost to secure its recognition
by the Pope, as well as by his brother, King Henry
of Germany; but he did not live to see the work
completed. He was a victim of that deadly pestilence
which swept away so many thousands.</p>
<p>Our young friends, who survived all the perils of

that unfortunate crusade and had wept at the grave
of the heroic Emperor, now mourned for his great-hearted
son. They deemed it their highest honor
to enter the Teutonic order and in its service to
perform the two great Christian duties:</p>
<p>To strive for the doctrines of Christ; and</p>
<p>To obey his highest command, &ldquo;Love one
another.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="fnblock"><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_1" href="#fr_1">[1]</a>The first Crusade for the recovery of the Holy Land from the infidels, as they
were called, was led by Godfrey of Bouillon (1096-1099), and resulted in the
capture of Jerusalem. The second (1147-1149), advocated by Saint Bernard,
was unsuccessful. The third (1189-1192), in which Frederick Barbarossa of Germany,
Richard the Lion-hearted of England, and Phillip Augustus of France were
associated, failed in the reconquest of Jerusalem, which the Musssulmans had retaken
in 1187. The fourth (1202-1204) resulted in the establishment of a Latin
Empire at Constantinople, under Count Baldwin of Flanders. The fifth, under
Frederick II (1228-1229), the sixth (1248-1250) and the seventh (1270-1271),
under St. Louis of France, were unsuccessful.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_2" href="#fr_2">[2]</a>Godfrey of Bouillon was horn in Brabant in 1061, and died in Jerusalem in
1100. He was made Duke of Lower Lotharingia, Germany, in 1088, and joined
the Crusade in 1096. He was the leader in the capture of Jerusalem and was
made its King, but preferred to be known as Protector of the Holy Sepulchre. He
completed the conquest of the Holy Land by defeating the Sultan at Ascalon, 1099.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_3" href="#fr_3">[3]</a>Saint Bernard, a French ecclesiastic, was born in Burgundy in 1091, and
died at Clairvaux in 1153. He became abbot of Clairvaux in 1115, and held that
position until his death. He had great influence in ecclesiastical politics, and
preached the second Crusade in 1146.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_4" href="#fr_4">[4]</a>The succession about this period was as follows: The Saxon dynasty (Henry
I, Otto I, Otto II, and Otto III) reigned from 919 to 1002. At the death of Otto
III, no representative of that dynasty was left. He was succeeded by Henry II,
who reigned from 1002 to 1024. After his death the Franconian dynasty
(Conrad II, Henry III, Henry IV, and Henry V) occupied the throne from
1024 to 1125, the dynasty ending with the death of Henry V. The latter was
succeeded by Lothair, Duke of Saxony, who reigned from 1125 to 1137. At
his death, Conrad III of the Hohenstaufen dynasty was elected. He reigned from
1137 to 1152, and was succeeded by Frederick Barbarossa, his nephew, and son
of Frederick, Duke of Swabia, who reigned from 1152 to 1190.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_5" href="#fr_5">[5]</a>Henry the Lion was the son of Henry the Proud. He was of such haughty
disposition and so ambitious that he was generally disliked, but Frederick succeeded
in making him Duke of Bavaria and Saxony. He did much for these duchies by
building new towns and colonizing them, and by founding bishoprics.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_6" href="#fr_6">[6]</a>The Guelphs, or Welfs, as they were called in Germany, were the papal
party in Italy in the Middle Ages. They were the founders of the house of
Brunswick and Hanover to which the present English royal family belongs. The
Ghibellines were the imperial and aristocratic party in Italy who derived their name
from Waiblingen, an estate in Franconia. The conflict between the two parties
was begun in Germany and transferred to Italy, where it raged until the end of the
fifteenth century.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_7" href="#fr_7">[7]</a>Conrad&rsquo;s election had been called hasty and irregular.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_8" href="#fr_8">[8]</a>Frederick&rsquo;s appellation, &ldquo;Barbarossa&rdquo; in Italian, &ldquo;Rothbart&rdquo; in German,
came from his red beard.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_9" href="#fr_9">[9]</a>This refers to Henry I (919-936) who subdued the Magyars and the Slavs
(including the Bohemians), recovered German territory from Denmark, and rid
Germany of all its enemies.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_10" href="#fr_10">[10]</a>Tortoria, in the province of Alessandria, Italy, was a conspicuous sufferer in
many wars. It was destroyed by Frederick Barbarossa in 1155, again by the
Ghibellines in 1163, and was several times captured in the War of the Spanish
Succession.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_11" href="#fr_11">[11]</a>Lodi, in the province of Milan, was founded by Barbarossa in place of the
Lodi destroyed in 1158. It is the locality of the great victory won by the French
under Napoleon over the Austrians under Beaulieu, May 10, 1796. It is now
principally famous for its Parmesan cheese and Majolica ware.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_12" href="#fr_12">[12]</a>Frederick&rsquo;s army was composed of 100,000 foot and 15,000 horse.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_13" href="#fr_13">[13]</a>Crema is in the Province of Cremona and about twenty-four miles from
Milan.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_14" href="#fr_14">[14]</a>Frederick set out for Germany attended by thirty horsemen, and at Susa only
saved himself by escaping on foot at night with two followers.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_15" href="#fr_15">[15]</a>Frederick&rsquo;s first wife was Adelaide, whom he married in 1147 and divorced
in 1153, upon the pretext of kinship. In 1156 he married Beatrice, mentioned
above, daughter of the Count of Burgundy.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_16" href="#fr_16">[16]</a>Saladin, the Egyptian
Sultan, was born at Tekrit in 1137, and died at Damascus
in 1193. He was made Sultan in 1173, and conquered Damascus and Syria.
He defeated the Christians at Tiberias in 1187, and also captured Acre,
Jerusalem, and Ascalon. The fall of Jerusalem led to the third Crusade, in which
Frederick Barbarossa, Richard the Lion-hearted of England, and Philip II of France
took part. In 1192 Richard forced Saladin to make a three years&rsquo; truce. Saladin
died before its expiration.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_17" href="#fr_17">[17]</a>Guy de Lusignan succeeded to the throne of Jerusalem in 1186, on the death
of Baldwin V. After his capture by Saladin he was released on renouncing his
claims to the throne; but he disregarded his agreement, and in 1192 transferred
his claim to Richard I of England, in exchange for Cyprus.

<i>Matthew</i> x, 29.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_32" href="#fr_32">[32]</a>The Templars were a military order, taking their name from the temple of
Solomon, where they had their early headquarters in Jerusalem. The order was
founded in 1118, and its object was to protect pilgrims on the way to the shrines
in the Holy Land. They spread rapidly and rose to great power; but after being
charged with heresy, immorality, and other offences, the order was suppressed by
the Council of Vienne in 1312.</div>
<div class="fncont">The Knights of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem were organized early in the
twelfth century. The order was a religious and charitable body, and was also semi-military
in character. Associations which trace their origin to this order are still
in existence, among them the &ldquo;Johannites&rdquo; in Germany, and the Knights of
St. John in England.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_33" href="#fr_33">[33]</a>This was the Teutonic Order, or Teutonic Knights of St. Mary&rsquo;s Hospital at
Jerusalem. Its name is derived from a German hospital founded at Jerusalem in
1128. It at one time played an important part in the political history of northern
Europe and it had much to do with the spread of Christianity and German national
life. About all left of the order now is a semi-religious knighthood in Austria
presided over by an archduke, which was restored in 1840, after Napoleon suppressed
the whole order (1809).

<p class="center small"><i>A new, interesting, and very useful series that will be found especially
<br />suitable for school libraries and for supplementary reading</i></p>
<p>The books in this series are translated from the German, because
in that country a specialty is made of really desirable
reading for the young. Eight titles are now ready and more will
follow.</p>
<p>Their simplicity and accuracy make them very useful for every
school library in the grades.</p>
<p>For parents who feel disposed to give their children books that
provide a mild element of historical information, as well as first-class
entertainment, the little books will prove a veritable find.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;life-stories&rdquo; retain the story form throughout, and embody
in each chapter a stirring event in the life of the hero or the action
of the time. The dramatis person&aelig; are actual characters, and the
facts in the main are historically correct. They are therefore both
entertaining and instructive, and present biography in its most attractive
form for the young.</p>
<p class="center smaller">A FULL LIST OF THE TITLES IS GIVEN ON THE NEXT PAGE</p>
<p>The work of translation has been done by Mr. George P.
Upton, whose &ldquo;Memories&rdquo; and Lives of Beethoven, Haydn, and
Liszt, from the German of Max Mueller and Dr. Nohl, have been
so successful.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
